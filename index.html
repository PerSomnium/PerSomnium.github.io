        <p>The light from the summer sun always lit up the city in the most splendid of ways.  The rays caught on windows not yet thrown open to the morning’s air, and a gentle breeze pulled the salty smell of the ocean over the maze of alleyways and side streets.  It was still early for Asier, many of her inhabitants were likely just now rubbing the sleep from their eyes.  Only the occasional cart passed William on the streets, or the odd clattering from the rooftops, 100 feet above.  As William knew all too well, it really didn’t matter what time of day it was, the roofs were a constant source of activity.</p>
<p>If even a single event of the morning had been different, William would have likely just taken a buggy to the Regia.  It was certainly less work and afforded him an opportunity to catch up on paperwork uninterrupted, but <em>this</em> morning made the prospect seem sour.  Sleep was restless last night (which wasn’t exactly new, but still),  and he misplaced his watch the evening before which resulted in a several minute struggle this morning that put him just late enough to not have enough time to get coffee.  All of that would be irrelevant, obnoxious but weatherable, if not for the unfortunate report that appeared on his desk.  He was really, really hoping that business with the Alynth Order would bear fruit, would have made the whole situation a lot easier.  Alas, their offices held absolutely nothing of interest, a complete dead end.  This left William’s options as follows: he could sit in a cart and read through what would be an incredibly disappointing pile of paper or he could make the ride himself.  The answer ended up being obvious, he needed some activity to help him wake up anyways.</p>
<p>At least his horse was having a good morning.  The grey stallion was reveling in the cool morning air, practically prancing along the cobble streets.  It had been a while, hadn’t it.  In terms of horses, nobody would say his didn’t live a privileged life.  Octavian was, after all, an expertly trained warhorse.  They were treated quite well, worth more than their weight in gold… maybe.</p>
<p>But it really had been a while, things had been busy, work had left William grasping for minutes.  Not that it was a very good excuse, it wasn’t the stallion’s fault.</p>
<p>Alas, the downfall of the “ride to the Regia” plan.  If William was just sitting on a horse trotting to a building full of stuffy bureaucrats he had time to think, and if he had too much time to think it could quickly devolve into doubt.   Not that things hadn’t been complicated recently.  A few or so weeks ago marked the beginning of a chase, the beginning of an investigation against a little underground drug trade that had been allowed to operate for <em>far too long.</em>  But of course, it’s never just a little trade or a little drugs, in fact, lately the whole situation had taken some very… strange turns.  Wrapping illegal business up in other facets of Asier’s admittedly cluttered culture was a nice strategy to avoid law enforcement.  Doesn’t work, obviously, but its very rude and overcomplicating and those sorts of people love stuff like that.  And only four months into William’s tenure too.  What a mess. </p>
<p>The quiet morning rides invited the introspection but if William was being honest with himself his mess started before the odd drugs.  It… had been a long, irregular four months, and William had taken to actively avoiding any thought regarding the circumstances.  It was less confusing that way.  So much he didn’t understand, and William just wasn’t the sort of person to be content not understanding.  Really, the best he could do was try not to let his mind wander to far; better to focus on the task at hand, not what kept him restless at night.</p>
<p>The load noise of a yelling stall keep snapped him out of his thoughts, and it was rather telling of his current state that he didn’t even register reaching Annabelle Square.  The plaza sat in the divide between the Docks and Cliffs region of the city, the latter which housed essentially all of Asier’s governmental activity, both city and state.  Cliffs wasn’t Williams jurisdiction, that would be the Docks, but meetings with Guardsmen from other sects or discussions with Asier’s more political authority figures typically took place there.   As for Annabelle Square, being prime real estate nestled lovingly between the Affluent Cliffs and the Entrepreneurial Docks meant it was an excellent location for small shop keeps to drag out carts and bug passerby’s to purchase their goods.  This one here was getting out bright and early.  </p>
<p>The sounds of the woman yelling “Captain!” snapped William’s attention.  As soon as she had it she went into a short sales pitch, trying to sell her pastries.  She was middle aged and had a remarkable amount of energy for seven-seventeen in the morning. William gave her a quick wave, a head shake, and tried to ignore her as he continued through the square.  Truthfully, he was unsure if she actually knew who he was.  She might of just matched the regalia to the rank, though, it wouldn’t be unusual for someone such as her to know his name.  His coronation was irregular, the circumstances regarding the change from the last Docks Captain to the current brought significant attention.  For a week or so, William’s face was in every newspaper.  The whole city got to know him overnight.  And it was only four or so months ago that he still lived in relative anonymity.  He wondered when it would feel normal, if it would ever.  He wondered how long it took <em>him.</em></p>
<p>While Asier was Asier, the Cliffs region had a distinctly different feeling to it then the Docks.  As William continued on his journey the buildings began to change.  They went from scrappy high rises to elegant villas and fancy gardens.  The roads themselves were cleaner, wider.  It lacked the crisscross of wires and ropes overhead.  William weaved through the cleanly laid cobblestone passing the more sophisticated storefronts and ornate residences. To own property in this portion of the city… Once upon a time William had looked up some listings, just for curiosities sake.  The amount had made him balk.  Asier was known for taking care of her civil servant but nothing even close to that degree.  He was vaguely aware of a provincial law somewhere that subsidized housing in the Cliffs for high level civil servants who worked in the nearby buildings, but it was nothing he had ever pursued, nor would he.  Besides the very obvious reason that he was the Docks Captain and thus would live in the region he guarded, William just wasn’t a big fan of the Cliffs.  It’s not to say it wasn’t nice, because it was a very very nice, but the character was different. It came off too pompous, it took itself far too seriously.  The Docks felt so much more accepting, the people more diverse.  The food was better.  The food was much better.</p>
<p>He reached the point where the journey was largely over.  Just a little further north and the manors and cottages turned into stately courthouses and assembly halls. Past them all, nestled up and into the cliff, the Regia.  It was an impressive building, perhaps more accurately described as a compound.  It laid out like a stretched cat right up against the Emerbriand Precipice.  In typical Asier fashion it also reached up several stories towards the clouds.  William remembered the first time he saw it in person.  To say the Regia was the most impressive building in all of Asier’s domain would be an insult to the Arcanium, but its had its own distinct grandeur.  The building was composed of masterfully crafted stonework and ornate decorations.  Long tiled halls echoed as busied administrators hurried to their next engagement.  William’s mentor brought him rather early in his career; he remembered the awe he felt during first sight, the extensive gardens, the massive flags displaying Asier’s kingfisher.  The Regia was every bit a perfect center of government.  Of course, after getting dragged out early in the morning for far too many asinine meetings, William had lost the awe he felt the first time.  Nonetheless, it held a special place in the heart of all Aseerans.  In fact, it could be quite a stereotype, if the complaints William heard from foreign travelers were true.  He’s heard wanderers from Witneon grumble of Aseeran’s lack of wonder at their famous structures. “Oh yes, the Perpinau Castle is very nice of course, but have you seen the Regia?”  The more things change right?</p>
<p>A number of guards stood at attention, scattered up the road leading to the complex.  Keeping an eye on the Regia was a rather easy assignment.  It was so deep into the Cliffs region; very little disruption made it that far into the city.  Most of the men and women here were likely having a pleasant morning, keeping an eye on the tulips and the wandering civil servants. Their silver mail shined in the light, adorned with decorations in Asier’s blue.  Spears and swords were shined and sharpened to a point.  Every sentry donned a blue brassard on their left triceps, and every brassard had Asier’s bird on it.  William’s was no exception, his just had more bars.  Most of the guards gave him an acknowledgement of some kind as he walked by, a salute, a nod.   Technically, they all should have saluted him but William didn’t care, and at this point they all knew he didn’t care as well.  None of these men were his anyways; Regia was cliffs, so they all fell under Sacha Orikass’s command.  He cared far more about formalities than William did.  Cliffs could be uptight like that.</p>
<p>Not far from the steps William dropped off Octavian to a waiting stable hand then continued up into the building.  The many sets of double doors opened up into a wide chamber.  The cathedral ceiling reached up many floors, and along both the left and right wall hung a plethora of flag.  As per tradition, each reigning senator was to place a flag of their family crest along the walls of the Antechamber.  If they didn’t have a crest they got to make one.  Asier had a number of artists and historians on hold ready to whip something up for green senators in need.  It was an old tradition that served no real point anymore, but the Aseerans still clung to it.  All the pomp and circumstances made the occasion feel special.  Same reason William was technically “Sir Belafose”.</p>
<p>He walked past the waiting chairs and secretaries into the greater chamber.  The Regia got a lot of foot traffic; government centers were always a busy place.  With the amount of people coming in and out of the building someone had the bright idea to hide the coffee.  It would make William late for his meeting but he didn’t care too much.  They could wait, it wouldn’t kill them. </p>
<p>It always struck William as strange how the culture of the different guards districts could be so contrasting.  Back in the docks, nobody was ever on time for meetings.  People would meander over a few minutes after the meeting had already begun, and then stop to get coffee on the way.  It was different here, people were early.  Mind blowing. </p>
<p>After a not insignificant amount of turns, William made his way to the small alcove.  The coffee wasn’t scalding hot anymore but it would do the job, and someone had dropped off a plate of croissants.  William didn’t actually work in this building.  Whoever brought the croissants hadn’t brought them with the Commander of the Docks in mind.  He took one, and then was startled by the voice behind him.</p>
<p>“Good morning Captain Belafose.”</p>
<p>He turned around.  Roselyne Cassini’s smiling face stood in the doorway.  She was entirely in uniform, as expected.  Her silver and blue jacket was neat, her slacks freshly ironed, light brown hair tied up in a tight bun.  Cleanly put together like always.</p>
<p>“Ah, morning Lieutenant.” </p>
<p>Roselyne was one of Sacha’s. William didn’t get to work with her a lot because of that, but they’ve wound up in the same escapades on occasion.  Few more and they would probably be on a first name basis.  She made for the coffee as well. </p>
<p>“Did you ride in today?” </p>
<p>“Hm?” At this point William was solidly late, but Roselyne was nicer to talk to than anyone who would be at today’s meeting.  They could keep waiting. “Hopefully I don’t look that rough.”</p>
<p>Roselyne chuckled. “No, just a bit disheveled. Here.” She pulled a small powder compact and flipped the mirror open.  William set down his coffee and pastry.</p>
<p>She was right, he wasn’t looking the best.  Admittedly, he didn’t try too hard this morning, but the wind from the ride rustled quite a few hairs out of place, and he was sporting some dark circles under his eyes from all the sleep he didn’t get last night.  William did his best to fix the flyaways. He was a very typical Episeeran, blond hair, the archetypal pigment-less grey eyes.  He narrowed them at his reflection.  It struck him how out of place he looked compared to her, with her perfectly done up hair and sophisticated makeup.  She looked like she actually belonged in the Regia.</p>
<p>And just like that an uncomfortable feeling gripped the back of William’s throat.  His existence always felt a little skewed in this building.  Thousands ran around playing their perfect, very essential roles as cogs in the greater machine that made the state tick and, William stood in the middle of it, overwhelmed by the noise.  He tried to remember, the words echoed in his ear.  <em>Ours</em> wasn’t a life of gears and pistons. Ours was <em>more.</em>  Ours was <em>different</em>. Ours was bound and captivated by a single fervent desire to…</p>
<p>“Captain?”</p>
<p>William looked up.  Roselyne had the slightest look of concern on her face.  He handed back the mirror.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” He gave a slight headshake. “I’ve had a lot on my mind lately.”</p>
<p>“Oh I bet!  I know it wasn’t an easy transition.”  She gave him an enthusiastic pat on the shoulder.  “But you’re doing great, I promise!” All William could do was put on a polite smile.  </p>
<p>She flashed him a smile back, then grabbed her coffee and made to head out into the greater compound.  William wondered if she would consider a transfer.  Someone like that was wasted on Sacha.  Speaking of whom…</p>
<p>It was seven-forty-one and if William was any later he was going to get positively grilled.</p>
<p>He made his way through the hallways, up a few staircases and into the Administration of Domestic Protection.   Sinna’s division was at the end of the hallway.  If William was remembering correctly today was in meeting room 422.  </p>
<p>The blinds were drawn on the small window embedded in the door, but the sounds of conversation could just be heard from the outside.  William turned the door handle and entered.  The second Sinna’s eyes landed on him she was scowling. He grabbed the nearest seat. </p>
<p>“So nice of you to finally join us Captain Belafose.”</p>
<p>Once, Sinna had been intimidating to him.  The first time she formally met him was on his promotion to Lieutenant.  Before that she likely never bared him a thought, William wasn’t <em>relevant</em> enough.  If first impression were everything Sinna had shot herself in the foot.  When William was presented by his mentor he expected a handshake from her, some social formalities, a congratulations maybe.  She didn’t even look at him like a person. Her narrowed eyes tore apart every bit of his presentation, his expression, the miniscule bits of his uniform out of place.  She was probably trying to unnerve him, and to be fair she did succeed, but wouldn’t anyone?  He was warned she could be eccentric but William didn’t expect dehumanizing.  And once she had her fill of whatever she saw in him she continued on like he wasn’t even there.  For quite a while William danced around her, but respect through fear rarely lasts.  Needless to say, Sinna wasn’t the biggest fan of “Captain Belafose”.  She did her best to block his ascension through the ranks four or so months ago.  Unfortunately for Sinna, her power to prevent such an outcome was limited.</p>
<p>William put on the sincerest smile he could and met her eyes, her annoyance made it better.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome, Commissioner Bahlin.”</p>
<p>She looked no happier.  “As I was saying before your punctual arrival, I have updates regarding code 328.1.  I have sent your request to the Ministry of Justice, and provided nothing out of the ordinary comes up you should receive a decision sometime within the next four or so weeks.”</p>
<p>William chewed on that for a second.  Four weeks was a difficult pill to swallow and his immediate inclination was to argue. He thought back, and tried to remember how long changes like this have taken in the past.  This was his first time levying his position in an attempt to get around a real legal code, so his experience was rather limited. There were situations from the past, from back before he was Captain.  While he only had a vague remembrance, he would have to check official records, he was positive it was shorter than four weeks.</p>
<p>“Has it always taken so long?  I feel as if the timeline for such amendments in the past was… shorter?” William tapered off.  The other two Captains in the room eyed him.  William was the one to make the request, but the proposed amendment would affect all three of them.  All the others were also permitted a say.  He could tell from their faces neither Captain Levalor or Captain Orikass were overly pleased about the hike to this meeting, or at the very least Avilli Levalor wasn’t.  Sacha Orikass worked here, in this very complex.  He was likely grumpy for grumpy’s sake.  He currently frowned in William’s direction.</p>
<p>As far as William was concerned, Sacha Orikass had two facial expressions, indifference and annoyance.  He was tall and scarily muscled. Cleanly shaved, sharp facial features, dark skin, short black hair .  He looked like military personnel. William wouldn’t be considered short, but Sacha had more than a few inches, and easily sixty pounds, on him.  Fortunately he wasn’t shorter than Avilli Levalor, who currently looked at William with a perfected poker face.  She had been Captain for a while now.  Her dark brown hair sported a grey strip, and she also had the same intimidating military look down pat.  If it came with the position William hadn’t gotten his in the mail yet.  A thin scar adorned her right cheek; William had never asked the circumstances of it.  He looked between them, it was Sacha who addressed him first.</p>
<p>“You are misremembering.” Always short and to the point. </p>
<p>“Perhaps.” William gave a little shrug.  “This is my first time attempting such things.  Like I said, I can’t remember the timeline perfectly.”</p>
<p>Sinna began again. “Unfortunately, Captain Belafose, the Senate decided to call a recess yesterday.  Thus, the Minister is out and minor matters are to be delayed a week, and more pressing matters of state will need to be addressed once sessions have begun again.”  That was indeed unfortunate.  William wondered how information about this recess got past him.  He thought for a second, took a sip of his coffee and decided to try his luck.</p>
<p>“Is it possible to push up review on the code?  It’s been quite a hinderance lately.”</p>
<p>Sinna narrowed her eyes.  “All I could do is ask, but I have no plans to.” Oh, she was going to be difficult.</p>
<p>William took a breath.  “When I say quite a hinderance, I mean a major hinderance, Commissioner.  The Shatter investigation has gotten gated by this exact code multiple times.  Its slowing down progress enough that…”</p>
<p>She rose her voice over his. “I am aware of this Captain Belafose, I still see no reason to request the timeline be adjusted.  In the meanwhile you can work around the code.”</p>
<p>“That is what we are currently doing, clearly it is inhibiting progress. I don’t understand the problem with a simply request.”</p>
<p>“The docks region has completed many investigations regarding contraband substances…”</p>
<p>William interrupted.  “I don’t see how that has anything to do with it.”</p>
<p>In the briefest of moments, before Sinna could continue, Avilli spoke up. “Manton Stockwell never needed such amendments.”</p>
<p><em>Holy shit.</em></p>
<p>William took a sharp breath in.  Avilli looked at him, Sacha and Sinna looked at him. He took a careful breath out.  “…Understood.”</p>
<p>A awkward pause filled the room.  Sinna continued,  “Given that matter is now settled…” and began another discussion with Sacha.  William half listened.  It was a cheap shot.  As if Manton Stockwell didn’t ask for amendments when he needed it.  And nicely done bringing up the other drug cases.  Did Sinna forget it was William on those very investigations.  Oftentimes it was him who drove their conclusions. There was a reason he was picked for the position.  This code hadn’t been amended because <em>nobody had been peddling drugs through religious institutions.</em>  William seethed, he seethed very quietly.  If he wouldn’t be given to tools to fix the issues in the docks region, then the bureaucrats in the Regia would just have to wait longer for those issues to be fixed.  It was so strange too.  William spent most of the last several years working very closely with Manton.  There were never as many issues as there had been these last few months.  Since Manton’s disappearance and William’s related promotion, Sinna had been a constant deeply nagging thorn in his side.  And William didn’t miss how Sacha and Avilli treated him differently than how they treated Manton.  It was a respect thing, no doubt, but short of resigning William couldn’t, and wouldn’t, change the position they all were in.  Its not like he was happy about all this… Manton’s disappearance, the new role.  William thought he had years before he would become a Captain.  Support from the top would go so far for him…</p>
<p>William picked at his stolen croissant through the rest of the meeting.  It was a fairly dull affair, Sinna discussed some Gates and Cliffs related matters with Avilli and Sacha.  Once she was through her agenda they were dismissed in the holier than thou, condecsending sort of way Sinna dismissed her pathetic underlings. William didn’t stick around for any small talk, in fact he left as fast as he could without looking strange. It was a pretty good hike back to the docks, and in the short half hour or so he’d been there the Regia had begun to grate on him.  He’d probably be simmering about the comparison to Manton for the next several hours.  Perhaps once he was back in his region it would dull.  He navigated through the hallways and down several staircases.  William gave a small nod to the secretaries as he walked through the Antechamber.  Through one of the many sets of double doors and William stood outside in the light of the sun.  The outside air smelt clean and fresh after being stuck in the stuffy building.  Despite it all, it was still a pleasant summer’s day.</p>

        <p>Deep within the docks district, nestled in between the high rise buildings and thin roads, was Bell Yard.   It didn’t sit far from Asier’s shipyard and on a clear, quiet day, the sounds of bells from incoming vessels could faintly be heard, thus the appropriate nickname.  The formal denomination was “Asier Dock Precinct Center of Guard Command”, but that was a horrible mouthful.  Bell Yard had a better ring to it.  It was another sprawling compound with offices, holding cells, barracks, training grounds - a huge organism, entirely focused on guarding the docks.  Near the center was Building Seventeen, and in one of its hallways William’s footsteps echoed alongside Hakra Aronnel’s. </p>
<p>It had been an involved day.  William and Hakra’s attention was turned to the same affair, but they hadn’t been fortunate enough to cross paths.  William just managed to catch him, and they walked back to their side of the building together.  Hakra was regaling him with updates from the day.  It was work speak, but it was work speak with Hakra, which significantly improved the matter.</p>
<p>“And I’m not sure if you’ve heard yet, but the Arcanium wants to meet, their representative said they had updates.” </p>
<p>William was under the impression the mages were dragging their feet, they did quite frequently. “Really, they made it sound like analysis would take a while.”</p>
<p>Hakra chuckled, “I know, I was suprised too.  This Tempides, 10 AM, they want you and me there.”</p>
<p>“Very nice, are we going to bully some wizards?”</p>
<p>He barked out a laugh.  “No like I said, I think they actually have something this time around.”  He paused, his demeanor growing more inquisitive.  “I’m curious what made them put out results so fast.”</p>
<p>The Arcanium served a great many purposes, and the guards of all districts often called on them for aid.  It was a very longstanding working relationship, dating back to the Arcanium’s original conception.  They were meant to be the center of all magical development in Asier, but at this point they had substantially reached beyond their original purpose.  The Arcanium housed scientists and engineers, they supported architects and artists, they comingled with politicians.  All visionaries were welcomed in their massive, <em>massive,</em> walls.  Whenever the guard found a fancy new elicit substance they sent it off to the Arcanium.  They would make sense of it and send back a report.  They were very good at what they do but they could at times be slow.  In William’s experience, sometimes “gentle coercion” was required.  That wasn’t shaping up to be the case this time around. </p>
<p>“Yeah…” Curious indeed.  “It’s out of character for them.”</p>
<p>“Mhmm” Hakra replied.</p>
<p>William let the possibilites fly for a second.  Shatter had been a complicated case.  “I wonder what they found.”</p>
<p>Hakra let out a small coy smile.  “You have to wait until Tempidies.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately that was still two days away.  William sighed.</p>
<p>They reached a large glass door.  Hakra pulled it open and beckoned William through.  William would be lost for words if he had to describe how much he appreciated Hakra Aronnel.  The First Lieutenant was meticulous about his appearance, a very well put together individual with a bit of a spike to his dark brown hair and that olive skin native to the region.  William was fairly sure Hakra had ancestors from this delta, maybe ones who were here at the city’s humble inception.  They had been close from the very beginning.  While it was Manton Stockwell who originally plucked William fresh out of the academy, Hakra Aronnel handled much of his training in his early years, and did William need the training.  He had made quite an impression during his graduation, and when the docks caught wind they gave him a <em>highly attractive</em> offer.  Sergeant at the 18, in this day and age an unheard of prospect.  It was a leadership position for gods sake, Sergeants had <em>officers under them</em>.  At the time though, they had William organizing investigations under Hakra’s careful hand.  Two years later he’d be leading, but they let him settle first.  Manton admitted to him on a quiet night, years later, that he’d done it so William couldn’t refuse, to make it madness for William to take any other offer.  He would have done <em>anything</em>  to make William pick the docks.</p>
<p>Through the glass door, rows of desks, walls plastered with cork and covered in papers, busied guardsmen dressed in crisp blue and silver.  Broad windows bathed them all in the light of the sun.  There was pride here, pride in what was built and cultivated and lovingly maintained.  It was as much a home as any of the ones William had ever known, and it wasn’t the same without Manton Stockwell.</p>
<p>“So…” Hakra continued.  “Any plans for your day off?”</p>
<p>William made a non committal noise. </p>
<p>“Really, nothing.  Been a while since you’ve had time for yourself, hasn’t it.”</p>
<p>“Thirteen days, I’m thinking a quiet day in, get some rest, sleep in.”</p>
<p>Hakra scoffed, it was a small, not particularly impolite scoff, but it was still a scoff.  “That’s pretty optimistic coming from you.”</p>
<p>William had a bit of a reputation, he gave Hakra a look.</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean it…  I wish you luck then.  Knowing you I don’t know if it will help.”</p>
<p>As they neared the office a third voice spoke out.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, Captain, Lieutenant.” The secretary sat nestled behind the desk.  If she wanted to she could hide behind the folders and piles of paperwork.</p>
<p>Hakra raised a hand in greeting. “Afternoon”</p>
<p>“Hi Maria” William said.  Her eyes settled on him.  She dug underneath a pile and pulled out an ivory letter.</p>
<p>“Captain, a courier came by earlier, left a gift”  She reached up over the desk.</p>
<p>It was awfully small.  Probably not anything overly official.  “Really, I don’t know why they don’t just call…” William took the letter.  He gave the writing on the envelop a quick scan.  “<em>From the office of Enoch Larreau”</em></p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>William broke the seal.</p>
<p>“<em>William,</em></p>
<p><em>I heard through the grapevine you have tomorrow off.  Conveniently, the senate called a week recess, meaning I also find myself with downtime.  We should capitalize on this opportune day of freedom to get lunch.  I know you aren’t doing anything important, so I already made reservations at Lavande for 11:30.  Looking forward to it!</em></p>
<p><em>~Enoch”</em></p>
<p>Hakra breathed over William’s shoulder.  “That’s about what I expected.  You really are cursed.”</p>
<p>William closed up the paper and sighed.  Hakra continued.  “And he didn’t even give you a chance to cancel, so much for a quiet day in.  How you managed to catch his attention…”</p>
<p>“It could be worse, he always pays.”</p>
<p>“If he didn’t you couldn’t afford it, knowing his taste in restaurants.”  It was true, his senator friend always insisted on the finer establishments.</p>
<p>They walked side by side until they reached the offices.  Hakra’s had been the same for quite a while, the one to the right of the Captain’s.   As of four months ago William’s sat to his left.  </p>
<p>“I’m going to head out I think, enjoy your lunch.”  Hakra paused, and narrowed his eyes.  “And do try to get some rest tomorrow, you look a little…”</p>
<p>William finished “Rough?”</p>
<p>Hakra eyes were scrutinizing.  “Yes.”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>Hakra nodded, content.  “Be well, William”, and he entered his office.  William did the same.</p>
<p>He ambled in, tossed the paperwork he was carrying on the desk and sunk into the chair.  William had a number of documents that needed reviewing before he was free.  He idly flipped through them.  It was a rather nice office, pretty big, tall bookshelves on either side, a small couch nestled in the corner.  He dragged that one in himself.  The loveseat was a little small for naps but William made do.  The huge windows at the back of the room brought in a nice amount of natural light.  The desk was one hundred something years old, walnut and lovingly maintained, had been in this office since some master woodworker humbly carved it into existence.  A part of the Captain’s inheritance.</p>
<p>William spent the next hour or so skimming through the remaining reports and signing any requests that needed his approval.  The “Shatter Investigation” was the current attention hog, and a situation William was personally overseeing, but that didn’t mean there weren’t plenty of other matters of some importance his guard was involved with.  William’s job was to keep an eye on all of them; it made for some late nights.  As he worked his way through the papers, the sounds of people packing up and leaving for the day floated in from the Atrium.  Closing drawers and doors, retreating footsteps, the “Goodbyes” and “Have a nice evenings”.  After the worst of the administrivia was sorted he figured it was time to call it quits.  Anything else could wait for a day, and if there truly was an emergency Hakra and Chiara were decent enough at hunting him down.  </p>
<p>After all his paraphernalia was elegantly jammed into his Satchel, he made his way out of Building Seventeen and onto the main thoroughfare out of Bell Yard.  Luckily it wasn’t a long walk home - twenty minutes, fifteen if William walked fast.   A cable car did cover most of the route but William rarely made use of it, only after particularly exhausting days.  Walking was fine, walking was healthy, it was good exercise.  Also, he hadn’t forgotten the few times he sat next to someone who recognized him and the unfortunately awkward conversations that often resulted.  It was horrible enough to avoid the people mover.  Walking, healthy, no talking.</p>
<p>It was, after all, a very pleasant evening to be out.  Summer could get hot here, but the ocean did a good job keeping the temperature palatable, and today would probably be described by many as near perfect.  Only a few clouds took residence in the sky.  It was warm, but the cool breeze tunneling through the city made the conditions perfectly comfortable.  William walked slow, savoring the last of the daylight.  Dock’s looked lovely when the light dimmed and the sun started catching on windows.  There wasn’t a ton of foot traffic at the moment.  It was that fickle time between those with day jobs heading home and the night life coming out which left the world with a serenity that would be disturbed by more activity.  He passed a series of residences decorated with hanging plants and clothes left out to dry.  A number of people sat out on balconies thirty feet up, enjoying the air.  </p>
<p>Then William got to his street.  It was mostly housing and whatnot, a few businesses scattered throughout.  There was a corner store nestled up against the intersection and a small tavern all of two minutes away from William’s flat.  He made his to the latter and walked through the old wooden door.  It gave a long creak as he opened it.  The tavern was rather typical.  Wooden tables, charming atmosphere, a nice local place to buy a drink.  The lights were low and a radio in the corner was playing some light music.  A few patrons had already gotten comfortable up at the long bar in the back.  He gave a greeting to the bartender, and upon recognizing William she gave a wave and dove back into the kitchen.  Sometime… last year?  William couldn’t remember exactly, he made a habit of coming to this place for dinner.  Truthfully he always got the same thing, some salmon dish they made.  It was quite fresh fish, like all fish in this city really, and decent enough.  Wasn’t super expensive and pretty consistent, traits he’d come to value in seafood.  He took a seat at the bar suitably far away from everyone else and she brought out the food in a paper bag ten minutes later.  After trading a few Quills and an Orb he continued his walk home.</p>
<p>William was rather fortunate to find such a nice place to live back when he was looking to upgrade apartments three years ago.  It was a beautiful building, not new by any stretch of the word but well kept.  It might almost be considered historical.  A lot of building like it tended to have major revisions done and with it their storied backgrounds often stripped.  This one here escaped such a fate.  Just as William started looking a nice unit inside hit the market and all of a sudden he was a homeowner.  It was a pleasant change to no longer be renting, a testament that he was here to stay, not that there was any real question at that point.</p>
<p>He gently pushed open the double doors.  They had some nice glasswork inlaid that always prompted William to use a soft hand.  It absolutely wasn’t necessary, the doors had lasted so long at this point they could probably survive a siege, but nonetheless.  The lobby was small and mostly empty.  He made his way over to the stairs and lugged himself up the four flights, and then lugged himself down the hall to room 408.  After fumbling with the key he made it through the door.  He went straight for the living room, dropped the paper bag on the coffee table, undid his jacket buttons with practiced ease and sank into the couch cushions.</p>
<p>He needed a moment, that’s all.  William leaned his head back up against the top of the sofa and <em>breathed</em>.  He felt the way the air filled his chest, tried to release the tension in his hands, relaxed his shoulders.  He let it out, slowly and controlled.  The day was over, he had thirty-six hours before he had to spare any of it a thought again. Thirty-six hours to himself… although honestly, it was probably more like thirty-three.  Enoch would steal at a few.  That was no issue though, Enoch was a friend.  William opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>What a strange friend to have, Enoch Larreau.</p>
<p>William pulled out a newspaper he stole from the breakroom (<em>his</em> breakroom, not the Regia’s) and started picking at his dinner.  It was perfectly decent, just like the last however many times he had it.  As for the paper, there wasn’t anything particularly noteworthy.  The political happenings were sparse, likely due to the recess, and there weren’t any big articles otherwise.  The world was writing enticing stories not yet known to the public, William knew that for a fact, but he guessed nothing great had hit the light of day.  He set the paper on top of a pile of similar papers off to the side.  He made a point to keep up with the news, if only out of a sense of obligation.</p>
<p>When he finished he made his way to the bedroom and shrugged off the rest of his uniform.  The jacket and trousers  were neatly hung up, the undershirt was haphazardly tossed in the hamper and the suspenders were haphazardly tossed in the top drawer.  Once he was wearing clothes not as stifling as the guard’s attire, he trekked back to the kitchen.  He went for <em>that</em> whiskey, grabbed it by the neck and paused for a second, staring at the near empty bottle.  He blinked a few times before he poured the rest of it in a glass.  If William was remembering correctly that was the end of bottle seventeen.  He held it upside down and watched the precious last drops cause little ripples in the gold liquid.  Only three bottles remained of an incredibly impulsive decision, how nice.  </p>
<p>He went to the room right before his bedroom, the one where he set up his study.  It was cozy, homely, he switched on a lamp and it illuminated corner to corner with a warm light.  He sat down at the roll top desk, cluttered enough to be too inconvenient to ever close, and leaned back into the chair, letting out a deep sign he’d been holding in for a while as he swirled the whiskey in his glass. “Nightsong Rye Whiskey”, it was local, their distillery was only a few miles out from the city, and extraordinarily popular in Asier.  Very few bars in this area did not stock it.  That fact made William even more embarrassed about the whole situation, honestly.  At the time he intended to buy two fifths, one for that night and one to hide away, but the liquor store he went to was fresh out of stock.  It shouldn’t of caused him to panic, it was whiskey for God’s sake and a stupid popular one at that, but William couldn’t get the thought out of his head. What if the distillery closed, burned down, decided to make beer instead, the irrational fear of never experiencing that specific sensation again gave him whiplash.  So when the kind lady at the counter offered to hold some for him for tomorrow after the shipment came in, and she asked him how many he wanted, William hitched and added a zero.  At that point it was too late, he committed and got twenty bottles of it.  Such volatile times, a few months ago, and so bold of William to think back on them like they were over.</p>
<p>So with a crate full of liquor he decided to turn it into a nightly ritual.  Just one glass, no more, as he sat at his desk and combed over the documents, journals and his neatly written accounts.  In the end it sort of worked out.  There was something to be said for jogging memory with sensation from the past.  A sight, a smell could bring someone back to a moment long ago.  It took a familiar woody aroma and the gentle burn at the back of William’s throat, and he was him but years ago.</p>
<p>For all the times he’d sat in this exact moment, drinking this exact drink, it wasn’t even his favorite whiskey. </p>
<p>It was Manton Stockwell’s.</p>
<p>And as nice as the ritual was, he was reaching the point where it would have to be put on hold.  He’d done everything he could from his desk.  If William wanted to find his mentor he was going to have to do more than comb over old memories, he was going to have to go out and talk to people.  He’d been… hesitant to do so.  No longer would this be a private endeavor but a full investigation, and certainly others would take note.  What was it Maakeo said, “You should let him go.”</p>
<p>How erroneous.  She knew that William wasn’t capable of letting <em>anything</em> go. </p>
<p>He’d been chewing on the question of where first to look for a night or so now.  There were a few compelling leads.  He had some names found in documents Manton almost certainly didn’t want discovered.  They were without a doubt enticing, and William had the contacts and resources to quickly hunt them down if they were still in the city, but Manton had written down precious little additional information.  If William went that route who knew who he would find.  He had instead been considering settling for the devil he knew.  There were places Manton frequented that were out of the ordinary for a man like him, and the more William researched them the more they stuck out.  The one that caught his attention was a small map shop, Perien’s Cartography.  Manton claimed he was old friends with the owner, Connor Perien, and while William couldn’t confirm or deny that fact, he found odd letters addressed from the place, and the owner’s name was occasionally referenced in strange contexts.</p>
<p>William had been by, once.  Him and Manton had been on their way to the shipyard to speak with the supervisor there, and Manton had requested they stop by so he could pick something up.  Admittedly, Manton did seem friendly with the owner, and he picked up a decent sized envelop supposedly full of papers and they were on their way.  William couldn’t remember anything else of note.  </p>
<p>It wasn’t his only lead, but it would be a nice place to start.  If they really were old friends then Perien would know of William.  Maybe he spoke to Manton before the disappearance, noticed some odd behavior or something.  It had been a while but it was definitely worth a shot.  And there was always the chance… William couldn’t speak to how likely it was, but there was the chance Perien knew more than William did.  The documents sprawled in front of him certainly implied there was more than met the eye.</p>
<p>That had been the story William had put together from the remains of Manton Stockwell’s life.  He seemed so transparent, all that time he’d know him.  In the beginning Manton had an air of mystery of course, but as time went on he revealed bits and parts.  He so masterfully made it seem like he was giving William the full picture, and if William was being truthful with himself, did what Manton Stockwell do even count as deception?  After all, it was William who made the assumptions, William who though he knew the man.  After he was gone and William combed through his notes and letters and things he left behind, when William looked back on the conversations they had, he noticed the holes in the façade.   Manton was hiding things, so much of what William saw didn’t make any sense.  Documents full of text that seemed meaningless, notes referencing places that as far as William’s research showed didn’t exist.  The letters, written about absolutely nothing.  William felt the betrayal well up in his chest.  He put his elbows on the desk, his hands tangled in his hair.  He needed to calm down.  He willed himself to breath, in and out.  He let the air fill his chest, let it crowd out the tight feeling.  This was his doing.  If only he looked with sharper eyes all that time ago….</p>
<p>There was one question, that rose above the rest.  One burning question that had firmly carved out a home in William’s mind.  Surely, Manton Stockwell knew this would happen.  Even if William didn’t really know Manton, Manton absolutely knew William.  He would have had to know that if he left so much… mystery behind, that William would have no choice.  He must of known that William would end up digging through it, would nearly pull his hair out over it.  Because Manton and William were the same.  They were <em>more,</em>  they were <em>different.</em>  They were bound and captivated by the single fervent desire…</p>
<p>“To know.”</p>
<p>The fireplace crackled happily in the corner.  It was the exclusive light in the room, bathing the room in a warm glow.  It caught on the glass Manton was twirling in his hand, golden familiar liquid swirling around.  He had that wry smile on his face, and while William couldn’t see in the dim light, he knew Manton’s checks were softly flushed.</p>
<p>“Right?” He leaned in, his eyes were soft.  William could see the flames flicker in them.  “You’re like me, you need to know.”</p>
<p>“I suppose..?”  William’s brain was moving like molasses.  He was certainly still drunk, but not nearly as drunk as earlier.  Conversely, Manton was absolutely still as drunk as he was earlier, merrily continuing through the bottle of whiskey on the table.  He pulled it out when they got back to his place, insisting it was his favorite and he was going to subject William to it whether he liked it or not.  It was a fairly moot statement given everyone knew that was Manton’s favorite Whiskey, William thought it tasted fine and at this point he wouldn’t of said no to a little more, if only so Manton wasn’t drinking alone.  William was absolutely taking it slow though, he did <em>not</em> want to blackout.  He wanted to remember this, him and Manton speaking together, one on one.</p>
<p>“Don’t play coy with me Will.” Manton gestured with his glass towards William, the liquor nearly flying out.  “I knew the second I saw you.”</p>
<p>William tried to think back, their first meeting, he absolutely remembered, it just wasn’t coming quick enough.  He cocked an eyebrow.  “Really, the very second?”</p>
<p>Manton laughed, deep and hearty.  “Ah, maybe not the second, definitely by the interview, the first one, do you remember that?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” He did.</p>
<p>“There was something about you.  You know, at first you came off like any other academy kid, stuffy and official, pretending to be formal.”</p>
<p>William gave him a glare.  Manton immediately drew back with a laugh.  “Don’t worry, its not your fault they teach you to do shit like that.”  He sighed contently, took a long sip of the whiskey. </p>
<p>“But remember Will, how I asked you if you had any questions…” Another sip. “And you tore into me.  We sat there for an hour talking.  I’d never seen a candidate do that.”</p>
<p>“Well to be fair.” William pipped in. “How many candidate were you personally interviewing from the academy?”</p>
<p>That same wry smile.  He didn’t bother answering the question, too consumed by his current line of thought.  “It was then I knew, you had to be under me, if only so I could see where you would go.  Didn’t really matter to me how hard I had to bribe you.  And to see you now, a First Lieutenant…”</p>
<p>That had been what they were celebrating.  Maakeo and William got the promotion together, formally brought into an inner circle they’d been invading for some time.  William was stupid proud of it, even if it was only a matter of time.  Evidently Manton was as well.  They decided to hit the bar after the formalities were through, and when it got late and the others started calling it a night Manton slipped next to William and invited him to his home, to continue the celebration for at least a little longer. </p>
<p>“Hey” Manton raised his glass.  “To how far you’ve come.”  He had that sincere look on his face, pride flared in his eyes like the reflected fire, and William’s heart skipped.  He raised his glass, a clink ringed out among the crackling of the flames.  William opened his eyes.</p>
<p>He looked at his palm, stretched his fingers out, then went for the glass of whiskey and took a long sip.  He finished off bottle seventeen and felt the feeling of resolve in his heart compound, solidify.  Tomorrow, after Enoch, he would go to the map shop and prod Perien into giving him something.  He would do this, <em>he would know.</em></p>

        <p>“So you see, after the whole affair it seemed most wanted to call the recess a few days early.  Better than watching the Nationals struggle against themselves.”</p>
<p>Enoch waved his fork around as spoke, quickly and expressively.  William was trying his best to catch all of it, truly, but the restaurant was loud and Enoch often slipped into bureaucratese. </p>
<p>“You know the real loser here?”  He paused, it must of been for emphasis, because surely he knew William did not know the real loser.</p>
<p>“Erland Winther, and the Radiance Alliance can make such a stink when things don’t go their way.”</p>
<p>William mustered up the blankest expression he could.  Of Enoch’s many coworkers, William only went out of the way to learn the names of the important ones.</p>
<p>The senator smiled knowingly. “The Minority Whip.”  He paused, then waved his hand indifferently, like none of it matter anyways.  “You know how it is in the Chamber, and that’s enough about me anyways… Now how have you been?” Enoch leaned in a little, eyes narrow and curious.  “I’ve heard you’ve been having a good time with some high profile cases?” </p>
<p>William did understand, in an abstract sort of sense, “how it is in the chamber”.   Enoch once mentioned it was mostly paperwork and arguing, and that lined up well with William’s preconceived notions.  A lot of formalities and high society displays, but beneath the generic obligations of a typical career politician,  Enoch could be… quiet fiery.  Most Senate debates were open to the press, and William had listened in a few times when he knew Enoch was going to be taking the floor.  He had expected it to be entertaining, what he didn’t expect was just how alluring of a public speaker Enoch could be.  He would get worked up, sure, but he knew how to frame an idea, and he knew how to make that idea seem like the most important thing in the world.  William was surprised to learn it wasn’t a skill reserved for Enoch’s professional life.  He really was that passionate, if you lent him an ear he could go off for hours.  And of course, someone like that was also dangerously <em>curious</em>.</p>
<p>“You are aware most of my work is <em>confidential,</em> right?” William cocked an eyebrow at Enoch.  </p>
<p>Enoch waved his hand with a nonchalant flair.  “Nonsense, I have the highest security clearance in the state.”</p>
<p>“Who elected you again?”</p>
<p>“If I’m recalling correct you did.” </p>
<p>William huffed, and turned away, staring out at the restaurant.   Lavande was busy but Enoch picked a nice table up against the wall, although not a particularly quiet spot.  The dull roar of conversation echoed in William’s ear.  It was an upscale place, with its beautiful chandeliers and wooden floors, crisp white tablecloths and flowers, multiple forks.  The kind of place with a dress code.  William had to sneak his revolver underneath his vest, just barely concealed on his lower back.  He turned back to Enoch, who was busy cutting his crepes.  He had floofy greying hair and a warm smile, tender inquisitive eyes.  It was curious, so many of the people William considered his mentors held long lineages from this city.  Ancient roots tied to this land, reaching back for generations.  But then his thoughts turned to Manton, who came from travelers.  People who did not feel any allegiance to a specific place, who set out with reckless abandon.  You could see the world in his sharp features, his green eyes and salt and pepper hair.  William must of zoned out for a second, because Enoch stared at him from across the table.</p>
<p>“Would you believe me if I said I wasn’t the biggest fan of drug cases?”</p>
<p>Enoch cocked his head. “But aren’t you known for them?”</p>
<p>“Well, I led the investigation on Muse, but that case got more popularity than it deserved.  That’s where all the notoriety came from.”  William pushed his eggs around with his fork.  “They all start straightforward, and somewhere in the middle turn into disasters.”</p>
<p>Enoch looked around, leaned in, and spoke just loud enough to be heard over the background noise.  “Do tell.”</p>
<p>“So nosy.”</p>
<p>Enoch let out a small gasp.  “Don’t wound me like that, I’m just helping my dear friend to vent his frustrations.”</p>
<p>William heaved a sigh.  “You know how this city is, I swear every week some would be alchemist comes up with some supposedly brilliant compound, and they all want to keep their little underground operations too.  First step is to find the source and tell them to cut it out.”  </p>
<p>Enoch raised an eyebrow.  “Cut it out?”</p>
<p>“In more official terms, but more or less, yes.”  It was close enough.  What happened to the creators would come down to a lot of factors, malicious intent, operation scale, the Arcanium’s findings.  Obviously things could always go bad, but from William’s experience most of the time all that happened was asset seizure and new regulations.  “Shatter has been out on the street for a while now, although getting worse as of late, and every single time we trace it back…” William paused. “It leads to a church.”</p>
<p>Enoch still looked skeptical “A church.”</p>
<p>“Every… Single… Time” William placed his fork down with a little more force than he intended, then picked up his drink and took a sip.  It reached the unfortunate point of being more air than Mimosa.  </p>
<p>“Indoenists?”</p>
<p>William choked.  “Do you think I would have an investigation if the Indoenid Church of Radiant Light was peddling drugs?”</p>
<p>Enoch responded immediately. “No.”</p>
<p>“It’s all smaller unorthodox sects.  We found a strange one the other day, the Alynth Order.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard.”</p>
<p>“I doubt you would have, they only have one temple deep within Docks.”  William paused for another second, let his thoughts collect. “I didn’t know this before, but by law <em>all</em> religious institutions have special protections against searches.  There are stricter requirements for probable cause, and searches of ‘holy areas’ can’t be conducted unless the church is alerted <em>ahead of time</em>.” </p>
<p>Enoch blinked.</p>
<p>William kept going.  “Do you know how useless a search warrant is when the suspects are <em>aware of it?</em>“</p>
<p>“I imagine it does diminish their usefulness somewhat.”</p>
<p>“So I sent a request to the Ministry of Justice, in hopes of a possible exception or workaround, but you…” William pointed his fork at Enoch in casual accusation. “Decided to take a recess.  So the Minister of Justice is not working, and the office is only taking ‘priority tasks’, and my lovely boss considers this unimportant.”</p>
<p>“Well in my defense, the vote passed forty four to six, so you were getting a recess regardless of my input.”</p>
<p>William shot Enoch an unamused look.</p>
<p>Enoch hummed to himself.  “Sinna really isn’t assisting you?”</p>
<p>“No.  She said we’ve handled cases like these just fine in the past…  She can be difficult.”</p>
<p>Enoch nodded.  “I’ve heard.”  </p>
<p>William’s mind drifted.  He’d been increasingly frustrated with the circumstances.  He looked up and met eyes with Enoch, and his reassuring smile.</p>
<p>“You really shouldn’t lose so much sleep over it, William.  You’ll get a breakthrough soon, you always do.”  </p>
<p>The look in Enoch’s eyes said that it came from a place of friendly concern, but the sleep comments were beginning to get a little dull.  Even so, William found he couldn’t muster any blame towards his friend.  He was aware that it had become a problem.  More accurately it had been a problem for a little over two weeks that he had ignored, and ignoring wasn’t a good solution when all was said and done.  </p>
<p>Last night was no exception to the trend.  William had managed to toss himself awake at three in the morning, and after an indeterminate amount of time staring at the ceiling found himself heading to the bathroom to dig around for a glass bottle tucked away in the medicine cabinet.  He was aware, conceptually, that he’d been out of sleeping pills for two weeks, but the weight of the glass in his hand and the haze of the early morning led him to the conclusion that he would like to sleep more than he wouldn’t like to see a doctor.</p>
<p>William wasn’t the biggest fan of doctors.  He’d been taking the little tablets for years now, and it was the same exact song and dance whenever he went for more refills.  The clinic at Bell Yard had a number of physicians, and William’s always made a point to give him a hard time before she would write the script.  She’d pester him about his coffee habits, which he’d given up in the past with no noticeable change.  She’d get on him about drinking and stress, request he try meditation, as if he hadn’t tried already and found nothing worked.  It was tiring, but clearly not tiring enough, given William still consistently woke up in the middle of the night.  He figured he could go down during lunch sometime within the next few days and face the inevitable music.</p>
<p>What was it about the hours of the early morning, anyways?  William remembered standing in front of the mirror, looking at himself holding an empty bottle in his sleepwear with his hair disheveled.  William remembered looking into his own eyes, the pale grey, seeing ashes and cold dark stone. </p>
<p>He looked up to Enoch and gave a small smile.  “You’re likely right.”</p>
<p>Enoch confident smirk was larger. “Of course I am.”</p>
<p>A waitress must of stealthily dropped off more drinks, because William’s empty Mimosa was replaced with a fresh one.  He picked it up and took a sip.</p>
<p>Before he could set it down again, the sound of shattering glass filled the dining room, and then the scream resonated throughout the hall.</p>
<p>A woman, from the middle of the restaurant.  William didn’t even need time to think, he stood up and looked out over the room.  He found it quickly, the table with the knocked over chair.  He had to consciously relax his right hand.  Instinct had brought it to hover by his hip, by the revolver.  There wasn’t a need this immediate second.  As far as he could tell there was no danger, just a woman lying on the ground.  He could barely make her out from where he stood.</p>
<p>A number of patrons had stood up attempting to get a look at whatever the commotion was.  William shot Enoch the briefest of glances then made for the woman, working his way through the tables and people.  He pulled the brassard out of his pocket and yanked it up his left arm.  William reached the spot, and thankfully found it clear of people.  The woman, probably in her early forties, lay on the ground unconscious, surrounded by shattered glass.  A startled looking waiter stood over the scene, clutching his serving tray.  William called out to him and pointed to his armband.</p>
<p>“Could you grab a broom?”</p>
<p>The waiter stared at the brassard for a second, then back to William and nodded, mumbling out something that was probably a yes.  William walked over to the table, cautious of the glass.  A startled looking, conscious woman still sat, a hand over her mouth.  He made sure to speak slow and clear to her.</p>
<p>“Is this your friend?”</p>
<p>The woman nodded quickly.  William squatted down to the unconscious woman lying on her side.  It’d be best to get her on her back, but not with glass everywhere.</p>
<p>“Did anything happen before?  Was she grabbing her throat or coughing?”  He looked down.  She seemed to be breathing fine, and his worry dissipated slightly, until he caught sight of her arm.  It sported a thick red gash.</p>
<p>He heard the other woman behind him. “N-no, nothing like that, we were just talking, then Elena dropped her glass…”</p>
<p>“Was she drinking?”</p>
<p>“Just t-the one”</p>
<p>William looked up and was surprised to meet eyes with Enoch, standing a few feet away.  He must of followed William over.  His voice was measured and calm, and it rose above the surrounding disorder.  “How can I help?”</p>
<p>A small pool of blood was collecting around the woman’s arm.  William looked down to the wound then back up to Enoch.  “Could you stop the bleeding?”</p>
<p>Enoch leaned in to get a look, and his face twisted with concern upon the sight.  “Of course.”</p>
<p>In William’s peripheral vision, the waiter from earlier approached, carrying the requested broom.  While Enoch went looking for a clean napkin, they began to clear out the glass.  Once the worst of it was swept away William turned the woman on her back, and Enoch knelt down and pressed a cloth up against her arm.  A pained, sort of sympathetic sound barely escaped his throat.  William began checking her vitals; she was still breathing, her pulse was elevated but not scarily so.  He heard Enoch’s voice, but he didn’t look up.</p>
<p>“It seems rather deep…”</p>
<p>“Looks like it.”  William gave a look around, a few gawkers/good Samaritans stood around.  There was the original waiter too, his head held just a little higher, his face ever so slightly less aghast.  William picked the most helpful looking bystander.  “Go outside and yell for a guard.  Say there’s an unconscious woman with a deep cut.”  He returned a quick “Yes sir” and made off.  Then the waiter.  “Surely you have medical supplies somewhere?”  He nodded and returned to the backrooms.</p>
<p>She seemed stable enough.  William tried to respectfully undo her collar and belt, and he grabbed the purse underneath the table and used it to prop up her legs.  At this point there wasn’t much more he could do.  The cut was concerning of course, and would require stitches, but Enoch was doing his best with it.  They would have to wait for a Paramedic, or the woman to regain consciousness.  </p>
<p>William looked over to Enoch, the blood on his hands.  Their eyes met, and William could see the question linger behind them before Enoch could even ask.</p>
<p>“She’s okay, breathing fine.  I think she just fainted.  A paramedic should be on their way soon.”</p>
<p>Enoch nodded.  His hands were steady and determined, but the look on his face gave away his nerves.  “You’re doing fine.”</p>
<p>An uncomfortable chuckle escaped Enoch.  “I’m just glad to help.”</p>
<p>A minute or so later the waiter returned with the first aid kit and an employee William presumed was the manager.  He was in the middle of explaining who he was to the man when the woman began to stir next to him.  William stopped, placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ah Ma’am, please stay still.”</p>
<p>Her right arm was held rather firmly by Enoch, but she brought her left to her head.  She mumbled something, but William couldn’t make a discernable word out.  </p>
<p>“Ma’am, you’re in Lavande, the restaurant?  You seem to have passed out.”</p>
<p>She lowered her right hand, squinted her eyes as they were exposed to the light.  They eventually settled on William.</p>
<p>“I’m a guard.”  He made sure she could see his left arm.  “You passed out, cut your arm in the process.  Please stay still, the Medic should be here soon.”</p>
<p>For a moment she blinked, trying to get her wits about her, William bet.  He hadn’t actually paid much attention to how she looked.  The button up shirt she wore was covered in blue squares, and he had already undone the belt on her high waisted skirt.  It was high society wear, complimenting the cleanly done makeup and her curled dark brown hair.  William and Enoch both matched the look themselves, the restaurant did have a dress code after all.  </p>
<p>“Oh, a guard.”  The woman tensed up, ever so slightly.  She raised the good arm to try and push her hair out of her face, and then she looked around yet again, eyes hanging on Enoch this time, scrutinizing. </p>
<p>“Why do I feel I have seen you before?”</p>
<p>Enoch smiled politely.  “Perhaps in the newspaper, Miss.  My name is Enoch Larreau.”</p>
<p>She was regaining her wits, quite quickly actually.  It took her a second, but once the dots connected she exclaimed out, “The Senator!?”</p>
<p>Enoch was using that voice, the polite and formal one he used when speaking with the public.  “Exactly so.”</p>
<p>She began to fidget under William’s hand.  He kept it firm, but she managed to look around back to the table. </p>
<p>“Nadine!  This man is Senator Larreau, you know, the Minister of State?”</p>
<p>For the still conscious woman at the table, Nadine, what was once nervousness had melted into exasperation.  “Elena, please, you just passed out!”</p>
<p>Elena obviously hadn’t notice, but her jostling was giving Enoch a hard time.  William leaned in, gently squeezed her shoulder.  “Ma’am…”</p>
<p>She turned to him sharply.  “So, who does that make you?”</p>
<p>“Captain Belafose, of the docks, Ma’am please…”</p>
<p>He was once again sharply cut off.  “The new Captain!  Goodness me, so many prominent men, and helping me, how charming!”  She met William’s eyes.  “I do feel rather fine now though…”</p>
<p>William turned his tone commanding as he interrupted her.  “Ma’am.”</p>
<p>She abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>“You have a rather deep cut on your left arm.  Please stay still, we called the Medics, they should be here soon.”</p>
<p>She seemed stunned silent for a moment, before she looked back to Enoch, and the arm he clasped a pile of soaked red napkins and gauze to.  “A cut.  I… didn’t notice.”</p>
<p>“Do you feel any pain?”</p>
<p>She thought for a moment.  He seemed to have managed to get her to stop fidgeting at least.  “No… well, a dull sort of ache, but it feels… far away.”  She paused.  “Is that helpful?  It doesn’t feel right.”</p>
<p>William looked to Enoch, he held a puzzled expression.  Before William could respond Elena spoke up again.</p>
<p>“Did they dim the lights in here?  It seems darker.”</p>
<p>Enoch’s expression grew further bewildered, and for a moment William was too, but something popped into the back of his mind.</p>
<p>“Ma’am.”  He pointed to the armband.  “The color here, what do you see?  Does it look right?”  The brassards were Asier’s blue, it was plastered all over the city.  Unmistakable to anyone spending more than an hour walking her streets.</p>
<p>Elena spent a moment scrutinizing it then spoke quietly, her voice concerned  “No, it’s dull, grey.”  She squinted.  “Maybe little green too.”</p>
<p>“Do you feel a dropping sensation in your stomach.”</p>
<p>She thought for a moment, then looked a little stunned.  “Well now that you mention it…”</p>
<p>William put a hand to her forehead.  She was a little cold as well.  Fainting was also a symptom, and while the lower blood pressure could be caused by the cut…</p>
<p>“Well?”  Enoch was staring, his eyes demanded answers.</p>
<p>First to the woman.  “You’re fine.  It should wear off soon.” Hopefully.  Then to them both.  “Disordered color perception is a fairly sure sign of Arcanic Overexertion.  Its when the limited energy within a person gets pulled a little too hard.”  He looked back down to the woman, and gave her shoulder another reassuring squeeze.  “People only have so much fire in them, after all.”</p>
<p>She mouthed out the words “Arcanic Overexertion”, then blurted out “Wait, why?”</p>
<p>William shrugged.  “You would know better than me.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t think of anything that would cause…”  She began to fidget again.</p>
<p>“Please don’t worry Ma’am.  The Medics will know more.  It tends to wear off fairly quickly, so I don’t see any cause for concern.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, commotion lit up the entryway of the restaurant.  A few guards dressed in their polished armor and two Paramedics in their red and tan uniforms.  William gave Elena a reassuring smile and nod then passed off his spot to the medical personnel.  He exchanged a few words with the guards then walked over to Enoch.  He was standing on the outskirts of the chaos, hands bloody and looking, despite his best effort, unnerved.</p>
<p>“One of the perks of living in the city, right?” William said as he approached.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“The quick medical attention.  None of that is yours right?”  He gestured to Enoch’s hands.</p>
<p>Enoch looked at William with a muddled expression, then he looked to his hands, then he noticeably cringed.  “I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, William grabbed one and took a careful look.  “Just making sure, there was a lot of glass.”  He grabbed a napkin and tried to wipe the worst of it off.  After he was sure Enoch was completely unharmed, he let go.  “If you want to go clean up, I’ll wait by the table?”</p>
<p>Enoch spoke softly.  “Probably a good idea.”</p>
<p>They parted ways for the moment, and William returned to their original spot by the wall.  Their meal wasn’t entirely finished, but he didn’t have much of an appetite anymore, and William was positive Enoch didn’t either.  He did have most of a Mimosa left.  He sat down and took a long sip. </p>
<p>Arcanic Overexertion.  What a weird ailment to come across in the wild.  William had contended with people suffering from it in the past.  It wasn’t… completely unknown in his line of work.  After all, he frequently dealt with the consequences of wayward magic usage, and overexertion was a common result of such affairs.  Human beings had this remarkable ability to transpose their inner energies back out onto the outside world; that’s all it really was.  Life, light, what some would go so far to call the soul could be harnessed with either enough training or carefully engineered aids.  If one knew how, they could take that energy and direct it to change the “resting state” of the outside world.  A trained mage could start a fire with their hand, manipulate a sound, cause an object to float.  The only condition being it couldn’t be done for free.  That was where the overexertion came in.  The mage gave up their own energies, their own fire, to fuel the change they wished to see in the world, and if they gave up too much there were consequences.  Mainly a dropping in blood pressure and a complete loss of ability to correctly process sensory information.  It could get worse too, William knew, but most of the time the symptoms never went past that.  It was awfully hard to keep casting when unconscious.</p>
<p>William could have been wrong about the woman.  There was no way she was a mage, but Arcanic Overexertion could be spurred on from other external sources.  It didn’t matter much at this point anyways.  The medics would handle things from here, and if he was wrong they would be able to tell.</p>
<p>He heard the chair across from him pull out, and Enoch took a seat.</p>
<p>“Better?”</p>
<p>Enoch lifted a now clean palm up.  “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Good.”  William looked out to the middle of the restaurant.  Things seemed to be suitably handled.  He looked back to Enoch.  “Thank you for the help back there.  I know  it was a little….”</p>
<p>“Bloody?”</p>
<p>William nodded.</p>
<p>“Please, make no mention of it.”  Enoch leaned back in the chair.  “I know I’m not trained for these situations, such as you, but I am honestly just happy to be of assistance.”  He looked out to the paramedics, helping the woman into a stretcher.  “I will say, I’m not particularly keen to stay much longer though.”</p>
<p>“Let me flag someone down.”  It took a second, but after the two woman were escorted out of the restaurant William managed to make eye contact with the manager from earlier.  In a second he came over.  He immediately showered them with gratitude.  A little unnecessary in William’s opinion.</p>
<p>“And please don’t worry about the bill.”</p>
<p>Enoch was quick.  “Nonsense, we can pay.”  He looked around the manager to the now empty middle table.  “You dropped theirs though, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course, and I’ll get that for you right away then.”</p>
<p>William polished off the Mimosa, it would have been a sin to not finish it, really, and waited for the manager to return.  It didn’t take long, and Enoch immediately took out his wallet.  William was idly staring off into the dining room until he caught the flash of color.  He always forgot that Enoch had his family crest embroidered on its front.  It certainly added a uniqueness to the dark leather, but it helped that Enoch’s crest was so distinctive.  Seven white wings, arranged in a circle, and a flame held in the middle, trapped by the feathers.  William stared at it as Enoch counted out the Florins for the meal.  Then William stared at the Florins.  All eight of them.  Eight Florins for lunch, that was the real sin.  William would have taken the free meal.</p>
<p>When he was done Enoch looked over, and the two of them departed the establishment. </p>
<p>The fresh air hit William’s face, and he took a deep breath.  There were no taxis waiting outside, but one would come by soon enough.  For now Enoch still looked a little unsteady on his feet.  </p>
<p>“I’m going to ride with you home, I want to make sure you make it okay.”</p>
<p>Enoch looked over, in slight surprise.  “You don’t need to do that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it, I’m not busy today anyways.”</p>
<p>Enoch capitulated quickly with a small sigh.  For a moment they both stood, around them only the sounds of the city.  </p>
<p>William looked out to the road and then up to the surrounding buildings.  They didn’t reach as high here as they did in other other districts, but they still dwarfed any man who dare stand in their shadow.  He didn’t look to Enoch when he spoke.  “Take a deep breath.  Everyone is safe.”</p>
<p>Enoch did just that.  Against the backdrop of the city, the perpetual noise of civilization, they both waited.</p>
