    <section>
      <p>The light from the summer sun always lit up the city in the most splendid of ways.  The rays caught on windows not yet thrown open to the morning’s air, and a gentle breeze pulled the salty smell of the ocean over the maze of alleyways and side streets.  It was still early for Asier, many of her inhabitants were likely just now rubbing the sleep from their eyes.  Only the occasional cart passed William on the streets, or the odd clattering from the rooftops, 100 feet above.  As William knew all too well, it really didn’t matter what time of day it was, the roofs were a constant source of activity.</p>
<p>If even a single event of the morning had been different, William would have likely just taken a buggy to the Regia.  It was certainly less work and afforded him an opportunity to catch up on paperwork uninterrupted, but <em>this</em> morning made the prospect seem sour.  Sleep was restless last night (which wasn’t exactly new, but still),  and he misplaced his watch the evening before which resulted in a several minute struggle this morning that put him just late enough to not have enough time to get coffee.  All of that would be irrelevant, obnoxious but weatherable, if not for the unfortunate report that appeared on his desk.  He was really, really hoping that business with the Alynth Order would bear fruit, would have made the whole situation a lot easier.  Alas, their offices held absolutely nothing of interest, a complete dead end.  This left William’s options as follows: he could sit in a cart and read through what would be an incredibly disappointing pile of paper or he could make the ride himself.  The answer ended up being obvious, he needed some activity to help him wake up anyways.</p>
<p>At least his horse was having a good morning.  The grey stallion was reveling in the cool morning air, practically prancing along the cobble streets.  It had been a while, hadn’t it.  In terms of horses, nobody would say his didn’t live a privileged life.  Octavian was, after all, an expertly trained warhorse.  They were treated quite well, worth more than their weight in gold… maybe.</p>
<p>But it really had been a while, things had been busy, work had left William grasping for minutes.  Not that it was a very good excuse, it wasn’t the stallion’s fault.</p>
<p>Alas, the downfall of the “ride to the Regia” plan.  If William was just sitting on a horse trotting to a building full of stuffy bureaucrats he had time to think, and if he had too much time to think it could quickly devolve into doubt.   Not that things hadn’t been complicated recently.  A few or so weeks ago marked the beginning of a chase, the beginning of an investigation against a little underground drug trade that had been allowed to operate for <em>far too long.</em>  But of course, it’s never just a little trade or a little drugs, in fact, lately the whole situation had taken some very… strange turns.  Wrapping illegal business up in other facets of Asier’s admittedly cluttered culture was a nice strategy to avoid law enforcement.  Doesn’t work, obviously, but its very rude and overcomplicating and those sorts of people love stuff like that.  And only four months into William’s tenure too.  What a mess. </p>
<p>The quiet morning rides invited the introspection but if William was being honest with himself his mess started before the odd drugs.  It… had been a long, irregular four months, and William had taken to actively avoiding any thought regarding the circumstances.  It was less confusing that way.  So much he didn’t understand, and William just wasn’t the sort of person to be content not understanding.  Really, the best he could do was try not to let his mind wander to far; better to focus on the task at hand, not what kept him restless at night.</p>
<p>The load noise of a yelling stall keep snapped him out of his thoughts, and it was rather telling of his current state that he didn’t even register reaching Annabelle Square.  The plaza sat in the divide between the Docks and Cliffs region of the city, the latter which housed essentially all of Asier’s governmental activity, both city and state.  Cliffs wasn’t Williams jurisdiction, that would be the Docks, but meetings with Guardsmen from other sects or discussions with Asier’s more political authority figures typically took place there.   As for Annabelle Square, being prime real estate nestled lovingly between the Affluent Cliffs and the Entrepreneurial Docks meant it was an excellent location for small shop keeps to drag out carts and bug passerby’s to purchase their goods.  This one here was getting out bright and early.  </p>
<p>The sounds of the woman yelling “Captain!” snapped William’s attention.  As soon as she had it she went into a short sales pitch, trying to sell her pastries.  She was middle aged and had a remarkable amount of energy for seven-seventeen in the morning. William gave her a quick wave, a head shake, and tried to ignore her as he continued through the square.  Truthfully, he was unsure if she actually knew who he was.  She might of just matched the regalia to the rank, though, it wouldn’t be unusual for someone such as her to know his name.  His coronation was irregular, the circumstances regarding the change from the last Docks Captain to the current brought significant attention.  For a week or so, William’s face was in every newspaper.  The whole city got to know him overnight.  And it was only four or so months ago that he still lived in relative anonymity.  He wondered when it would feel normal, if it would ever.  He wondered how long it took <em>him.</em></p>
<p>While Asier was Asier, the Cliffs region had a distinctly different feeling to it then the Docks.  As William continued on his journey the buildings began to change.  They went from scrappy high rises to elegant villas and fancy gardens.  The roads themselves were cleaner, wider.  It lacked the crisscross of wires and ropes overhead.  William weaved through the cleanly laid cobblestone passing the more sophisticated storefronts and ornate residences. To own property in this portion of the city… Once upon a time William had looked up some listings, just for curiosities sake.  The amount had made him balk.  Asier was known for taking care of her civil servant but nothing even close to that degree.  He was vaguely aware of a provincial law somewhere that subsidized housing in the Cliffs for high level civil servants who worked in the nearby buildings, but it was nothing he had ever pursued, nor would he.  Besides the very obvious reason that he was the Docks Captain and thus would live in the region he guarded, William just wasn’t a big fan of the Cliffs.  It’s not to say it wasn’t nice, because it was a very very nice, but the character was different. It came off too pompous, it took itself far too seriously.  The Docks felt so much more accepting, the people more diverse.  The food was better.  The food was much better.</p>
<p>He reached the point where the journey was largely over.  Just a little further north and the manors and cottages turned into stately courthouses and assembly halls. Past them all, nestled up and into the cliff, the Regia.  It was an impressive building, perhaps more accurately described as a compound.  It laid out like a stretched cat right up against the Emerbriand Precipice.  In typical Asier fashion it also reached up several stories towards the clouds.  William remembered the first time he saw it in person.  To say the Regia was the most impressive building in all of Asier’s domain would be an insult to the Arcanium, but its had its own distinct grandeur.  The building was composed of masterfully crafted stonework and ornate decorations.  Long tiled halls echoed as busied administrators hurried to their next engagement.  William’s mentor brought him rather early in his career; he remembered the awe he felt during first sight, the extensive gardens, the massive flags displaying Asier’s kingfisher.  The Regia was every bit a perfect center of government.  Of course, after getting dragged out early in the morning for far too many asinine meetings, William had lost the awe he felt the first time.  Nonetheless, it held a special place in the heart of all Aseerans.  In fact, it could be quite a stereotype, if the complaints William heard from foreign travelers were true.  He’s heard wanderers from Witneon grumble of Aseeran’s lack of wonder at their famous structures. “Oh yes, the Perpinau Castle is very nice of course, but have you seen the Regia?”  The more things change right?</p>
<p>A number of guards stood at attention, scattered up the road leading to the complex.  Keeping an eye on the Regia was a rather easy assignment.  It was so deep into the Cliffs region; very little disruption made it that far into the city.  Most of the men and women here were likely having a pleasant morning, keeping an eye on the tulips and the wandering civil servants. Their silver mail shined in the light, adorned with decorations in Asier’s blue.  Spears and swords were shined and sharpened to a point.  Every sentry donned a blue brassard on their left triceps, and every brassard had Asier’s bird on it.  William’s was no exception, his just had more bars.  Most of the guards gave him an acknowledgement of some kind as he walked by, a salute, a nod.   Technically, they all should have saluted him but William didn’t care, and at this point they all knew he didn’t care as well.  None of these men were his anyways; Regia was cliffs, so they all fell under Sacha Orikass’s command.  He cared far more about formalities than William did.  Cliffs could be uptight like that.</p>
<p>Not far from the steps William dropped off Octavian to a waiting stable hand then continued up into the building.  The many sets of double doors opened up into a wide chamber.  The cathedral ceiling reached up many floors, and along both the left and right wall hung a plethora of flag.  As per tradition, each reigning senator was to place a flag of their family crest along the walls of the Antechamber.  If they didn’t have a crest they got to make one.  Asier had a number of artists and historians on hold ready to whip something up for green senators in need.  It was an old tradition that served no real point anymore, but the Aseerans still clung to it.  All the pomp and circumstances made the occasion feel special.  Same reason William was technically “Sir Belafose”.</p>
<p>He walked past the waiting chairs and secretaries into the greater chamber.  The Regia got a lot of foot traffic; government centers were always a busy place.  With the amount of people coming in and out of the building someone had the bright idea to hide the coffee.  It would make William late for his meeting but he didn’t care too much.  They could wait, it wouldn’t kill them. </p>
<p>It always struck William as strange how the culture of the different guards districts could be so contrasting.  Back in the docks, nobody was ever on time for meetings.  People would meander over a few minutes after the meeting had already begun, and then stop to get coffee on the way.  It was different here, people were early.  Mind blowing. </p>
<p>After a not insignificant amount of turns, William made his way to the small alcove.  The coffee wasn’t scalding hot anymore but it would do the job, and someone had dropped off a plate of croissants.  William didn’t actually work in this building.  Whoever brought the croissants hadn’t brought them with the Commander of the Docks in mind.  He took one, and then was startled by the voice behind him.</p>
<p>“Good morning Captain Belafose.”</p>
<p>He turned around.  Roselyne Cassini’s smiling face stood in the doorway.  She was entirely in uniform, as expected.  Her silver and blue jacket was neat, her slacks freshly ironed, light brown hair tied up in a tight bun.  Cleanly put together like always.</p>
<p>“Ah, morning Lieutenant.” </p>
<p>Roselyne was one of Sacha’s. William didn’t get to work with her a lot because of that, but they’ve wound up in the same escapades on occasion.  Few more and they would probably be on a first name basis.  She made for the coffee as well. </p>
<p>“Did you ride in today?” </p>
<p>“Hm?” At this point William was solidly late, but Roselyne was nicer to talk to than anyone who would be at today’s meeting.  They could keep waiting. “Hopefully I don’t look that rough.”</p>
<p>Roselyne chuckled. “No, just a bit disheveled. Here.” She pulled a small powder compact and flipped the mirror open.  William set down his coffee and pastry.</p>
<p>She was right, he wasn’t looking the best.  Admittedly, he didn’t try too hard this morning, but the wind from the ride rustled quite a few hairs out of place, and he was sporting some dark circles under his eyes from all the sleep he didn’t get last night.  William did his best to fix the flyaways. He was a very typical Episeeran, blond hair, the archetypal pigment-less grey eyes.  He narrowed them at his reflection.  It struck him how out of place he looked compared to her, with her perfectly done up hair and sophisticated makeup.  She looked like she actually belonged in the Regia.</p>
<p>And just like that an uncomfortable feeling gripped the back of William’s throat.  His existence always felt a little skewed in this building.  Thousands ran around playing their perfect, very essential roles as cogs in the greater machine that made the state tick and, William stood in the middle of it, overwhelmed by the noise.  He tried to remember, the words echoed in his ear.  <em>Ours</em> wasn’t a life of gears and pistons. Ours was <em>more.</em>  Ours was <em>different</em>. Ours was bound and captivated by a single fervent desire to…</p>
<p>“Captain?”</p>
<p>William looked up.  Roselyne had the slightest look of concern on her face.  He handed back the mirror.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” He gave a slight headshake. “I’ve had a lot on my mind lately.”</p>
<p>“Oh I bet!  I know it wasn’t an easy transition.”  She gave him an enthusiastic pat on the shoulder.  “But you’re doing great, I promise!” All William could do was put on a polite smile.  </p>
<p>She flashed him a smile back, then grabbed her coffee and made to head out into the greater compound.  William wondered if she would consider a transfer.  Someone like that was wasted on Sacha.  Speaking of whom…</p>
<p>It was seven-forty-one and if William was any later he was going to get positively grilled.</p>
<p>He made his way through the hallways, up a few staircases and into the Administration of Domestic Protection.   Sinna’s division was at the end of the hallway.  If William was remembering correctly today was in meeting room 422.  </p>
<p>The blinds were drawn on the small window embedded in the door, but the sounds of conversation could just be heard from the outside.  William turned the door handle and entered.  The second Sinna’s eyes landed on him she was scowling. He grabbed the nearest seat. </p>
<p>“So nice of you to finally join us Captain Belafose.”</p>
<p>Once, Sinna had been intimidating to him.  The first time she formally met him was on his promotion to Lieutenant.  Before that she likely never bared him a thought, William wasn’t <em>relevant</em> enough.  If first impression were everything Sinna had shot herself in the foot.  When William was presented by his mentor he expected a handshake from her, some social formalities, a congratulations maybe.  She didn’t even look at him like a person. Her narrowed eyes tore apart every bit of his presentation, his expression, the miniscule bits of his uniform out of place.  She was probably trying to unnerve him, and to be fair she did succeed, but wouldn’t anyone?  He was warned she could be eccentric but William didn’t expect dehumanizing.  And once she had her fill of whatever she saw in him she continued on like he wasn’t even there.  For quite a while William danced around her, but respect through fear rarely lasts.  Needless to say, Sinna wasn’t the biggest fan of “Captain Belafose”.  She did her best to block his ascension through the ranks four or so months ago.  Unfortunately for Sinna, her power to prevent such an outcome was limited.</p>
<p>William put on the sincerest smile he could and met her eyes, her annoyance made it better.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome, Commissioner Bahlin.”</p>
<p>She looked no happier.  “As I was saying before your punctual arrival, I have updates regarding code 328.1.  I have sent your request to the Ministry of Justice, and provided nothing out of the ordinary comes up you should receive a decision sometime within the next four or so weeks.”</p>
<p>William chewed on that for a second.  Four weeks was a difficult pill to swallow and his immediate inclination was to argue. He thought back, and tried to remember how long changes like this have taken in the past.  This was his first time levying his position in an attempt to get around a real legal code, so his experience was rather limited. There were situations from the past, from back before he was Captain.  While he only had a vague remembrance, he would have to check official records, he was positive it was shorter than four weeks.</p>
<p>“Has it always taken so long?  I feel as if the timeline for such amendments in the past was… shorter?” William tapered off.  The other two Captains in the room eyed him.  William was the one to make the request, but the proposed amendment would affect all three of them.  All the others were also permitted a say.  He could tell from their faces neither Captain Levalor or Captain Orikass were overly pleased about the hike to this meeting, or at the very least Avilli Levalor wasn’t.  Sacha Orikass worked here, in this very complex.  He was likely grumpy for grumpy’s sake.  He currently frowned in William’s direction.</p>
<p>As far as William was concerned, Sacha Orikass had two facial expressions, indifference and annoyance.  He was tall and scarily muscled. Cleanly shaved, sharp facial features, dark skin, short black hair .  He looked like military personnel. William wouldn’t be considered short, but Sacha had more than a few inches, and easily sixty pounds, on him.  Fortunately he wasn’t shorter than Avilli Levalor, who currently looked at William with a perfected poker face.  She had been Captain for a while now.  Her dark brown hair sported a grey strip, and she also had the same intimidating military look down pat.  If it came with the position William hadn’t gotten his in the mail yet.  A thin scar adorned her right cheek; William had never asked the circumstances of it.  He looked between them, it was Sacha who addressed him first.</p>
<p>“You are misremembering.” Always short and to the point. </p>
<p>“Perhaps.” William gave a little shrug.  “This is my first time attempting such things.  Like I said, I can’t remember the timeline perfectly.”</p>
<p>Sinna began again. “Unfortunately, Captain Belafose, the Senate decided to call a recess yesterday.  Thus, the Minister is out and minor matters are to be delayed a week, and more pressing matters of state will need to be addressed once sessions have begun again.”  That was indeed unfortunate.  William wondered how information about this recess got past him.  He thought for a second, took a sip of his coffee and decided to try his luck.</p>
<p>“Is it possible to push up review on the code?  It’s been quite a hinderance lately.”</p>
<p>Sinna narrowed her eyes.  “All I could do is ask, but I have no plans to.” Oh, she was going to be difficult.</p>
<p>William took a breath.  “When I say quite a hinderance, I mean a major hinderance, Commissioner.  The Shatter investigation has gotten gated by this exact code multiple times.  Its slowing down progress enough that…”</p>
<p>She rose her voice over his. “I am aware of this Captain Belafose, I still see no reason to request the timeline be adjusted.  In the meanwhile you can work around the code.”</p>
<p>“That is what we are currently doing, clearly it is inhibiting progress. I don’t understand the problem with a simply request.”</p>
<p>“The docks region has completed many investigations regarding contraband substances…”</p>
<p>William interrupted.  “I don’t see how that has anything to do with it.”</p>
<p>In the briefest of moments, before Sinna could continue, Avilli spoke up. “Manton Stockwell never needed such amendments.”</p>
<p><em>Holy shit.</em></p>
<p>William took a sharp breath in.  Avilli looked at him, Sacha and Sinna looked at him. He took a careful breath out.  “…Understood.”</p>
<p>A awkward pause filled the room.  Sinna continued,  “Given that matter is now settled…” and began another discussion with Sacha.  William half listened.  It was a cheap shot.  As if Manton Stockwell didn’t ask for amendments when he needed it.  And nicely done bringing up the other drug cases.  Did Sinna forget it was William on those very investigations.  Oftentimes it was him who drove their conclusions. There was a reason he was picked for the position.  This code hadn’t been amended because <em>nobody had been peddling drugs through religious institutions.</em>  William seethed, he seethed very quietly.  If he wouldn’t be given to tools to fix the issues in the docks region, then the bureaucrats in the Regia would just have to wait longer for those issues to be fixed.  It was so strange too.  William spent most of the last several years working very closely with Manton.  There were never as many issues as there had been these last few months.  Since Manton’s disappearance and William’s related promotion, Sinna had been a constant deeply nagging thorn in his side.  And William didn’t miss how Sacha and Avilli treated him differently than how they treated Manton.  It was a respect thing, no doubt, but short of resigning William couldn’t, and wouldn’t, change the position they all were in.  Its not like he was happy about all this… Manton’s disappearance, the new role.  William thought he had years before he would become a Captain.  Support from the top would go so far for him…</p>
<p>William picked at his stolen croissant through the rest of the meeting.  It was a fairly dull affair, Sinna discussed some Gates and Cliffs related matters with Avilli and Sacha.  Once she was through her agenda they were dismissed in the holier than thou, condecsending sort of way Sinna dismissed her pathetic underlings. William didn’t stick around for any small talk, in fact he left as fast as he could without looking strange. It was a pretty good hike back to the docks, and in the short half hour or so he’d been there the Regia had begun to grate on him.  He’d probably be simmering about the comparison to Manton for the next several hours.  Perhaps once he was back in his region it would dull.  He navigated through the hallways and down several staircases.  William gave a small nod to the secretaries as he walked through the Antechamber.  Through one of the many sets of double doors and William stood outside in the light of the sun.  The outside air smelt clean and fresh after being stuck in the stuffy building.  Despite it all, it was still a pleasant summer’s day.</p>
