Given my proclivity for describing my fledgling hobbies to anyone who will listen, there has been a tiny amount of interest in my writing.  I figured instead of having a bunch of unfinished PDFs floating around it might be better to just toss it up on a website.  That way I can keep everything in one place and make adjustments to my heart's content.  I also figured it would be a fun little programming project (it was! (thanks Evan!)). 

Anyways, I want to note that this is highly unfinished, clearly.  I'm also making a point of not cutting anything before putting it up here, so there are certainly weaker sections that probably wouldn't end up in a finished product.  I am editing along the way, sure, but looking back I can always find something I would like to adjust. I'll probably add a change log at some point just so I can keep track.

To that end, feel free to poke around, and please don't feel obligated to read if you aren't interested!  As of now (11/30/2020) it's sitting at just under 13000 words, which by my calculations would take the average reader, reading at 250 words per minute, 50 or so minutes to read.

If you find any typos or have any feedback let me know over discord or text!  Might put up a comment section too at some point, haven't yet decided.

Thanks for coming by!
