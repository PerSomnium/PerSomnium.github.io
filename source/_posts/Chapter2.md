Deep within the docks district, nestled in between the high rise buildings and thin roads, was Bell Yard.   It didn't sit far from Asier's shipyard and on a clear, quiet day, the sounds of bells from incoming vessels could faintly be heard, thus the appropriate nickname.  The formal denomination was "Asier Dock Precinct Center of Guard Command", but that was a horrible mouthful.  Bell Yard had a better ring to it.  It was another sprawling compound with offices, holding cells, barracks, training grounds - a huge organism, entirely focused on guarding the docks.  Near the center was Building Seventeen, and in one of its hallways William's footsteps echoed alongside Hakra Aronnel's. 

It had been an involved day.  William and Hakra's attention was turned to the same affair, but they hadn't been fortunate enough to cross paths.  William just managed to catch him, and they walked back to their side of the building together.  Hakra was regaling him with updates from the day.  It was work speak, but it was work speak with Hakra, which significantly improved the matter.

"And I'm not sure if you've heard yet, but the Arcanium wants to meet, their representative said they had updates." 

William was under the impression the mages were dragging their feet, they did quite frequently. "Really, they made it sound like analysis would take a while."

Hakra chuckled, "I know, I was suprised too.  This Tempides, 10 AM, they want you and me there."

"Very nice, are we going to bully some wizards?"

He barked out a laugh.  "No like I said, I think they actually have something this time around."  He paused, his demeanor growing more inquisitive.  "I'm curious what made them put out results so fast."

The Arcanium served a great many purposes, and the guards of all districts often called on them for aid.  It was a very longstanding working relationship, dating back to the Arcanium's original conception.  They were meant to be the center of all magical development in Asier, but at this point they had substantially reached beyond their original purpose.  The Arcanium housed scientists and engineers, they supported architects and artists, they comingled with politicians.  All visionaries were welcomed in their massive, *massive,* walls.  Whenever the guard found a fancy new elicit substance they sent it off to the Arcanium.  They would make sense of it and send back a report.  They were very good at what they do but they could at times be slow.  In William's experience, sometimes "gentle coercion" was required.  That wasn't shaping up to be the case this time around. 

"Yeah..." Curious indeed.  "It's out of character for them."

"Mhmm" Hakra replied.

William let the possibilites fly for a second.  Shatter had been a complicated case.  "I wonder what they found."

Hakra let out a small coy smile.  "You have to wait until Tempidies."

Unfortunately that was still two days away.  William sighed.

They reached a large glass door.  Hakra pulled it open and beckoned William through.  William would be lost for words if he had to describe how much he appreciated Hakra Aronnel.  The First Lieutenant was meticulous about his appearance, a very well put together individual with a bit of a spike to his dark brown hair and that olive skin native to the region.  William was fairly sure Hakra had ancestors from this delta, maybe ones who were here at the city's humble inception.  They had been close from the very beginning.  While it was Manton Stockwell who originally plucked William fresh out of the academy, Hakra Aronnel handled much of his training in his early years, and did William need the training.  He had made quite an impression during his graduation, and when the docks caught wind they gave him a *highly attractive* offer.  Sergeant at the 18, in this day and age an unheard of prospect.  It was a leadership position for gods sake, Sergeants had *officers under them*.  At the time though, they had William organizing investigations under Hakra's careful hand.  Two years later he'd be leading, but they let him settle first.  Manton admitted to him on a quiet night, years later, that he'd done it so William couldn't refuse, to make it madness for William to take any other offer.  He would have done *anything*  to make William pick the docks.

Through the glass door, rows of desks, walls plastered with cork and covered in papers, busied guardsmen dressed in crisp blue and silver.  Broad windows bathed them all in the light of the sun.  There was pride here, pride in what was built and cultivated and lovingly maintained.  It was as much a home as any of the ones William had ever known, and it wasn't the same without Manton Stockwell.

"So..." Hakra continued.  "Any plans for your day off?"

William made a non committal noise. 

"Really, nothing.  Been a while since you've had time for yourself, hasn't it."

"Thirteen days, I'm thinking a quiet day in, get some rest, sleep in."

Hakra scoffed, it was a small, not particularly impolite scoff, but it was still a scoff.  "That's pretty optimistic coming from you."

William had a bit of a reputation, he gave Hakra a look.

"Oh, you mean it...  I wish you luck then.  Knowing you I don't know if it will help."

As they neared the office a third voice spoke out.

"Good afternoon, Captain, Lieutenant." The secretary sat nestled behind the desk.  If she wanted to she could hide behind the folders and piles of paperwork.

Hakra raised a hand in greeting. "Afternoon"

"Hi Maria" William said.  Her eyes settled on him.  She dug underneath a pile and pulled out an ivory letter.

"Captain, a courier came by earlier, left a gift"  She reached up over the desk.

It was awfully small.  Probably not anything overly official.  "Really, I don't know why they don't just call..." William took the letter.  He gave the writing on the envelop a quick scan.  "*From the office of Enoch Larreau"*

Oh.

William broke the seal.

"*William,*

*I heard through the grapevine you have tomorrow off.  Conveniently, the senate called a week recess, meaning I also find myself with downtime.  We should capitalize on this opportune day of freedom to get lunch.  I know you aren't doing anything important, so I already made reservations at Lavande for 11:30.  Looking forward to it!*

*~Enoch"*

Hakra breathed over William's shoulder.  "That's about what I expected.  You really are cursed."

William closed up the paper and sighed.  Hakra continued.  "And he didn't even give you a chance to cancel, so much for a quiet day in.  How you managed to catch his attention..."

"It could be worse, he always pays."

"If he didn't you couldn't afford it, knowing his taste in restaurants."  It was true, his senator friend always insisted on the finer establishments.

They walked side by side until they reached the offices.  Hakra's had been the same for quite a while, the one to the right of the Captain's.   As of four months ago William's sat to his left.  

"I'm going to head out I think, enjoy your lunch."  Hakra paused, and narrowed his eyes.  "And do try to get some rest tomorrow, you look a little..."

William finished "Rough?"

Hakra eyes were scrutinizing.  "Yes."

"I will."

Hakra nodded, content.  "Be well, William", and he entered his office.  William did the same.

He ambled in, tossed the paperwork he was carrying on the desk and sunk into the chair.  William had a number of documents that needed reviewing before he was free.  He idly flipped through them.  It was a rather nice office, pretty big, tall bookshelves on either side, a small couch nestled in the corner.  He dragged that one in himself.  The loveseat was a little small for naps but William made do.  The huge windows at the back of the room brought in a nice amount of natural light.  The desk was one hundred something years old, walnut and lovingly maintained, had been in this office since some master woodworker humbly carved it into existence.  A part of the Captain's inheritance.

William spent the next hour or so skimming through the remaining reports and signing any requests that needed his approval.  The "Shatter Investigation" was the current attention hog, and a situation William was personally overseeing, but that didn't mean there weren't plenty of other matters of some importance his guard was involved with.  William's job was to keep an eye on all of them; it made for some late nights.  As he worked his way through the papers, the sounds of people packing up and leaving for the day floated in from the Atrium.  Closing drawers and doors, retreating footsteps, the "Goodbyes" and "Have a nice evenings".  After the worst of the administrivia was sorted he figured it was time to call it quits.  Anything else could wait for a day, and if there truly was an emergency Hakra and Chiara were decent enough at hunting him down.  

After all his paraphernalia was elegantly jammed into his Satchel, he made his way out of Building Seventeen and onto the main thoroughfare out of Bell Yard.  Luckily it wasn't a long walk home - twenty minutes, fifteen if William walked fast.   A cable car did cover most of the route but William rarely made use of it, only after particularly exhausting days.  Walking was fine, walking was healthy, it was good exercise.  Also, he hadn't forgotten the few times he sat next to someone who recognized him and the unfortunately awkward conversations that often resulted.  It was horrible enough to avoid the people mover.  Walking, healthy, no talking.

It was, after all, a very pleasant evening to be out.  Summer could get hot here, but the ocean did a good job keeping the temperature palatable, and today would probably be described by many as near perfect.  Only a few clouds took residence in the sky.  It was warm, but the cool breeze tunneling through the city made the conditions perfectly comfortable.  William walked slow, savoring the last of the daylight.  Dock's looked lovely when the light dimmed and the sun started catching on windows.  There wasn't a ton of foot traffic at the moment.  It was that fickle time between those with day jobs heading home and the night life coming out which left the world with a serenity that would be disturbed by more activity.  He passed a series of residences decorated with hanging plants and clothes left out to dry.  A number of people sat out on balconies thirty feet up, enjoying the air.  

Then William got to his street.  It was mostly housing and whatnot, a few businesses scattered throughout.  There was a corner store nestled up against the intersection and a small tavern all of two minutes away from William's flat.  He made his to the latter and walked through the old wooden door.  It gave a long creak as he opened it.  The tavern was rather typical.  Wooden tables, charming atmosphere, a nice local place to buy a drink.  The lights were low and a radio in the corner was playing some light music.  A few patrons had already gotten comfortable up at the long bar in the back.  He gave a greeting to the bartender, and upon recognizing William she gave a wave and dove back into the kitchen.  Sometime... last year?  William couldn't remember exactly, he made a habit of coming to this place for dinner.  Truthfully he always got the same thing, some salmon dish they made.  It was quite fresh fish, like all fish in this city really, and decent enough.  Wasn't super expensive and pretty consistent, traits he'd come to value in seafood.  He took a seat at the bar suitably far away from everyone else and she brought out the food in a paper bag ten minutes later.  After trading a few Quills and an Orb he continued his walk home.

William was rather fortunate to find such a nice place to live back when he was looking to upgrade apartments three years ago.  It was a beautiful building, not new by any stretch of the word but well kept.  It might almost be considered historical.  A lot of building like it tended to have major revisions done and with it their storied backgrounds often stripped.  This one here escaped such a fate.  Just as William started looking a nice unit inside hit the market and all of a sudden he was a homeowner.  It was a pleasant change to no longer be renting, a testament that he was here to stay, not that there was any real question at that point.

He gently pushed open the double doors.  They had some nice glasswork inlaid that always prompted William to use a soft hand.  It absolutely wasn't necessary, the doors had lasted so long at this point they could probably survive a siege, but nonetheless.  The lobby was small and mostly empty.  He made his way over to the stairs and lugged himself up the four flights, and then lugged himself down the hall to room 408.  After fumbling with the key he made it through the door.  He went straight for the living room, dropped the paper bag on the coffee table, undid his jacket buttons with practiced ease and sank into the couch cushions.

He needed a moment, that's all.  William leaned his head back up against the top of the sofa and *breathed*.  He felt the way the air filled his chest, tried to release the tension in his hands, relaxed his shoulders.  He let it out, slowly and controlled.  The day was over, he had thirty-six hours before he had to spare any of it a thought again. Thirty-six hours to himself... although honestly, it was probably more like thirty-three.  Enoch would steal at a few.  That was no issue though, Enoch was a friend.  William opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling.

What a strange friend to have, Enoch Larreau.

William pulled out a newspaper he stole from the breakroom (*his* breakroom, not the Regia's) and started picking at his dinner.  It was perfectly decent, just like the last however many times he had it.  As for the paper, there wasn't anything particularly noteworthy.  The political happenings were sparse, likely due to the recess, and there weren't any big articles otherwise.  The world was writing enticing stories not yet known to the public, William knew that for a fact, but he guessed nothing great had hit the light of day.  He set the paper on top of a pile of similar papers off to the side.  He made a point to keep up with the news, if only out of a sense of obligation.

When he finished he made his way to the bedroom and shrugged off the rest of his uniform.  The jacket and trousers  were neatly hung up, the undershirt was haphazardly tossed in the hamper and the suspenders were haphazardly tossed in the top drawer.  Once he was wearing clothes not as stifling as the guard's attire, he trekked back to the kitchen.  He went for *that* whiskey, grabbed it by the neck and paused for a second, staring at the near empty bottle.  He blinked a few times before he poured the rest of it in a glass.  If William was remembering correctly that was the end of bottle seventeen.  He held it upside down and watched the precious last drops cause little ripples in the gold liquid.  Only three bottles remained of an incredibly impulsive decision, how nice.  

He went to the room right before his bedroom, the one where he set up his study.  It was cozy, homely, he switched on a lamp and it illuminated corner to corner with a warm light.  He sat down at the roll top desk, cluttered enough to be too inconvenient to ever close, and leaned back into the chair, letting out a deep sign he'd been holding in for a while as he swirled the whiskey in his glass. "Nightsong Rye Whiskey", it was local, their distillery was only a few miles out from the city, and extraordinarily popular in Asier.  Very few bars in this area did not stock it.  That fact made William even more embarrassed about the whole situation, honestly.  At the time he intended to buy two fifths, one for that night and one to hide away, but the liquor store he went to was fresh out of stock.  It shouldn't of caused him to panic, it was whiskey for God's sake and a stupid popular one at that, but William couldn't get the thought out of his head. What if the distillery closed, burned down, decided to make beer instead, the irrational fear of never experiencing that specific sensation again gave him whiplash.  So when the kind lady at the counter offered to hold some for him for tomorrow after the shipment came in, and she asked him how many he wanted, William hitched and added a zero.  At that point it was too late, he committed and got twenty bottles of it.  Such volatile times, a few months ago, and so bold of William to think back on them like they were over.

So with a crate full of liquor he decided to turn it into a nightly ritual.  Just one glass, no more, as he sat at his desk and combed over the documents, journals and his neatly written accounts.  In the end it sort of worked out.  There was something to be said for jogging memory with sensation from the past.  A sight, a smell could bring someone back to a moment long ago.  It took a familiar woody aroma and the gentle burn at the back of William's throat, and he was him but years ago.

For all the times he'd sat in this exact moment, drinking this exact drink, it wasn't even his favorite whiskey. 

It was Manton Stockwell's.

And as nice as the ritual was, he was reaching the point where it would have to be put on hold.  He'd done everything he could from his desk.  If William wanted to find his mentor he was going to have to do more than comb over old memories, he was going to have to go out and talk to people.  He'd been... hesitant to do so.  No longer would this be a private endeavor but a full investigation, and certainly others would take note.  What was it Maakeo said, "You should let him go."

How erroneous.  She knew that William wasn't capable of letting *anything* go. 

He'd been chewing on the question of where first to look for a night or so now.  There were a few compelling leads.  He had some names found in documents Manton almost certainly didn't want discovered.  They were without a doubt enticing, and William had the contacts and resources to quickly hunt them down if they were still in the city, but Manton had written down precious little additional information.  If William went that route who knew who he would find.  He had instead been considering settling for the devil he knew.  There were places Manton frequented that were out of the ordinary for a man like him, and the more William researched them the more they stuck out.  The one that caught his attention was a small map shop, Perien's Cartography.  Manton claimed he was old friends with the owner, Connor Perien, and while William couldn't confirm or deny that fact, he found odd letters addressed from the place, and the owner's name was occasionally referenced in strange contexts.

William had been by, once.  Him and Manton had been on their way to the shipyard to speak with the supervisor there, and Manton had requested they stop by so he could pick something up.  Admittedly, Manton did seem friendly with the owner, and he picked up a decent sized envelop supposedly full of papers and they were on their way.  William couldn't remember anything else of note.  

It wasn't his only lead, but it would be a nice place to start.  If they really were old friends then Perien would know of William.  Maybe he spoke to Manton before the disappearance, noticed some odd behavior or something.  It had been a while but it was definitely worth a shot.  And there was always the chance... William couldn't speak to how likely it was, but there was the chance Perien knew more than William did.  The documents sprawled in front of him certainly implied there was more than met the eye.

That had been the story William had put together from the remains of Manton Stockwell's life.  He seemed so transparent, all that time he'd know him.  In the beginning Manton had an air of mystery of course, but as time went on he revealed bits and parts.  He so masterfully made it seem like he was giving William the full picture, and if William was being truthful with himself, did what Manton Stockwell do even count as deception?  After all, it was William who made the assumptions, William who though he knew the man.  After he was gone and William combed through his notes and letters and things he left behind, when William looked back on the conversations they had, he noticed the holes in the façade.   Manton was hiding things, so much of what William saw didn't make any sense.  Documents full of text that seemed meaningless, notes referencing places that as far as William's research showed didn't exist.  The letters, written about absolutely nothing.  William felt the betrayal well up in his chest.  He put his elbows on the desk, his hands tangled in his hair.  He needed to calm down.  He willed himself to breath, in and out.  He let the air fill his chest, let it crowd out the tight feeling.  This was his doing.  If only he looked with sharper eyes all that time ago....

There was one question, that rose above the rest.  One burning question that had firmly carved out a home in William's mind.  Surely, Manton Stockwell knew this would happen.  Even if William didn't really know Manton, Manton absolutely knew William.  He would have had to know that if he left so much... mystery behind, that William would have no choice.  He must of known that William would end up digging through it, would nearly pull his hair out over it.  Because Manton and William were the same.  They were *more,*  they were *different.*  They were bound and captivated by the single fervent desire...

"To know."

The fireplace crackled happily in the corner.  It was the exclusive light in the room, bathing the room in a warm glow.  It caught on the glass Manton was twirling in his hand, golden familiar liquid swirling around.  He had that wry smile on his face, and while William couldn't see in the dim light, he knew Manton's checks were softly flushed.

"Right?" He leaned in, his eyes were soft.  William could see the flames flicker in them.  "You're like me, you need to know."

"I suppose..?"  William's brain was moving like molasses.  He was certainly still drunk, but not nearly as drunk as earlier.  Conversely, Manton was absolutely still as drunk as he was earlier, merrily continuing through the bottle of whiskey on the table.  He pulled it out when they got back to his place, insisting it was his favorite and he was going to subject William to it whether he liked it or not.  It was a fairly moot statement given everyone knew that was Manton's favorite Whiskey, William thought it tasted fine and at this point he wouldn't of said no to a little more, if only so Manton wasn't drinking alone.  William was absolutely taking it slow though, he did *not* want to blackout.  He wanted to remember this, him and Manton speaking together, one on one.

"Don't play coy with me Will." Manton gestured with his glass towards William, the liquor nearly flying out.  "I knew the second I saw you."

William tried to think back, their first meeting, he absolutely remembered, it just wasn't coming quick enough.  He cocked an eyebrow.  "Really, the very second?"

Manton laughed, deep and hearty.  "Ah, maybe not the second, definitely by the interview, the first one, do you remember that?"

"Yes." He did.

"There was something about you.  You know, at first you came off like any other academy kid, stuffy and official, pretending to be formal."

William gave him a glare.  Manton immediately drew back with a laugh.  "Don't worry, its not your fault they teach you to do shit like that."  He sighed contently, took a long sip of the whiskey. 

"But remember Will, how I asked you if you had any questions..." Another sip. "And you tore into me.  We sat there for an hour talking.  I'd never seen a candidate do that."

"Well to be fair." William pipped in. "How many candidate were you personally interviewing from the academy?"

That same wry smile.  He didn't bother answering the question, too consumed by his current line of thought.  "It was then I knew, you had to be under me, if only so I could see where you would go.  Didn't really matter to me how hard I had to bribe you.  And to see you now, a First Lieutenant..."

That had been what they were celebrating.  Maakeo and William got the promotion together, formally brought into an inner circle they'd been invading for some time.  William was stupid proud of it, even if it was only a matter of time.  Evidently Manton was as well.  They decided to hit the bar after the formalities were through, and when it got late and the others started calling it a night Manton slipped next to William and invited him to his home, to continue the celebration for at least a little longer. 

"Hey" Manton raised his glass.  "To how far you've come."  He had that sincere look on his face, pride flared in his eyes like the reflected fire, and William's heart skipped.  He raised his glass, a clink ringed out among the crackling of the flames.  William opened his eyes.

He looked at his palm, stretched his fingers out, then went for the glass of whiskey and took a long sip.  He finished off bottle seventeen and felt the feeling of resolve in his heart compound, solidify.  Tomorrow, after Enoch, he would go to the map shop and prod Perien into giving him something.  He would do this, *he would know.*
