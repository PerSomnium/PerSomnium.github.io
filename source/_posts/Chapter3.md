"So you see, after the whole affair it seemed most wanted to call the recess a few days early.  Better than watching the Nationals struggle against themselves."

Enoch waved his fork around as spoke, quickly and expressively.  William was trying his best to catch all of it, truly, but the restaurant was loud and Enoch often slipped into bureaucratese. 

"You know the real loser here?"  He paused, it must of been for emphasis, because surely he knew William did not know the real loser.

"Erland Winther, and the Radiance Alliance can make such a stink when things don't go their way."

William mustered up the blankest expression he could.  Of Enoch's many coworkers, William only went out of the way to learn the names of the important ones.

The senator smiled knowingly. "The Minority Whip."  He paused, then waved his hand indifferently, like none of it matter anyways.  "You know how it is in the Chamber, and that's enough about me anyways... Now how have you been?" Enoch leaned in a little, eyes narrow and curious.  "I've heard you've been having a good time with some high profile cases?" 

William did understand, in an abstract sort of sense, "how it is in the chamber".   Enoch once mentioned it was mostly paperwork and arguing, and that lined up well with William's preconceived notions.  A lot of formalities and high society displays, but beneath the generic obligations of a typical career politician,  Enoch could be... quiet fiery.  Most Senate debates were open to the press, and William had listened in a few times when he knew Enoch was going to be taking the floor.  He had expected it to be entertaining, what he didn't expect was just how alluring of a public speaker Enoch could be.  He would get worked up, sure, but he knew how to frame an idea, and he knew how to make that idea seem like the most important thing in the world.  William was surprised to learn it wasn't a skill reserved for Enoch's professional life.  He really was that passionate, if you lent him an ear he could go off for hours.  And of course, someone like that was also dangerously *curious*.

"You are aware most of my work is *confidential,* right?" William cocked an eyebrow at Enoch.  

Enoch waved his hand with a nonchalant flair.  "Nonsense, I have the highest security clearance in the state."

"Who elected you again?"

"If I'm recalling correct you did." 

William huffed, and turned away, staring out at the restaurant.   Lavande was busy but Enoch picked a nice table up against the wall, although not a particularly quiet spot.  The dull roar of conversation echoed in William's ear.  It was an upscale place, with its beautiful chandeliers and wooden floors, crisp white tablecloths and flowers, multiple forks.  The kind of place with a dress code.  William had to sneak his revolver underneath his vest, just barely concealed on his lower back.  He turned back to Enoch, who was busy cutting his crepes.  He had floofy greying hair and a warm smile, tender inquisitive eyes.  It was curious, so many of the people William considered his mentors held long lineages from this city.  Ancient roots tied to this land, reaching back for generations.  But then his thoughts turned to Manton, who came from travelers.  People who did not feel any allegiance to a specific place, who set out with reckless abandon.  You could see the world in his sharp features, his green eyes and salt and pepper hair.  William must of zoned out for a second, because Enoch stared at him from across the table.

"Would you believe me if I said I wasn't the biggest fan of drug cases?"

Enoch cocked his head. "But aren't you known for them?"

"Well, I led the investigation on Muse, but that case got more popularity than it deserved.  That's where all the notoriety came from."  William pushed his eggs around with his fork.  "They all start straightforward, and somewhere in the middle turn into disasters."

Enoch looked around, leaned in, and spoke just loud enough to be heard over the background noise.  "Do tell."

"So nosy."

Enoch let out a small gasp.  "Don't wound me like that, I'm just helping my dear friend to vent his frustrations."

William heaved a sigh.  "You know how this city is, I swear every week some would be alchemist comes up with some supposedly brilliant compound, and they all want to keep their little underground operations too.  First step is to find the source and tell them to cut it out."  

Enoch raised an eyebrow.  "Cut it out?"

"In more official terms, but more or less, yes."  It was close enough.  What happened to the creators would come down to a lot of factors, malicious intent, operation scale, the Arcanium's findings.  Obviously things could always go bad, but from William's experience most of the time all that happened was asset seizure and new regulations.  "Shatter has been out on the street for a while now, although getting worse as of late, and every single time we trace it back..." William paused. "It leads to a church."

Enoch still looked skeptical "A church."

"Every... Single... Time" William placed his fork down with a little more force than he intended, then picked up his drink and took a sip.  It reached the unfortunate point of being more air than Mimosa.  

"Indoenists?"

William choked.  "Do you think I would have an investigation if the Indoenid Church of Radiant Light was peddling drugs?"

Enoch responded immediately. "No."

"It's all smaller unorthodox sects.  We found a strange one the other day, the Alynth Order."

"I've never heard."

"I doubt you would have, they only have one temple deep within Docks."  William paused for another second, let his thoughts collect. "I didn't know this before, but by law *all* religious institutions have special protections against searches.  There are stricter requirements for probable cause, and searches of 'holy areas' can't be conducted unless the church is alerted *ahead of time*." 

Enoch blinked.

William kept going.  "Do you know how useless a search warrant is when the suspects are *aware of it?*"

"I imagine it does diminish their usefulness somewhat."

"So I sent a request to the Ministry of Justice, in hopes of a possible exception or workaround, but you..." William pointed his fork at Enoch in casual accusation. "Decided to take a recess.  So the Minister of Justice is not working, and the office is only taking 'priority tasks', and my lovely boss considers this unimportant."

"Well in my defense, the vote passed forty four to six, so you were getting a recess regardless of my input."

William shot Enoch an unamused look.

Enoch hummed to himself.  "Sinna really isn't assisting you?"

"No.  She said we've handled cases like these just fine in the past...  She can be difficult."

Enoch nodded.  "I've heard."  

William's mind drifted.  He'd been increasingly frustrated with the circumstances.  He looked up and met eyes with Enoch, and his reassuring smile.

"You really shouldn't lose so much sleep over it, William.  You'll get a breakthrough soon, you always do."  

The look in Enoch's eyes said that it came from a place of friendly concern, but the sleep comments were beginning to get a little dull.  Even so, William found he couldn't muster any blame towards his friend.  He was aware that it had become a problem.  More accurately it had been a problem for a little over two weeks that he had ignored, and ignoring wasn't a good solution when all was said and done.  

Last night was no exception to the trend.  William had managed to toss himself awake at three in the morning, and after an indeterminate amount of time staring at the ceiling found himself heading to the bathroom to dig around for a glass bottle tucked away in the medicine cabinet.  He was aware, conceptually, that he'd been out of sleeping pills for two weeks, but the weight of the glass in his hand and the haze of the early morning led him to the conclusion that he would like to sleep more than he wouldn't like to see a doctor.

William wasn't the biggest fan of doctors.  He'd been taking the little tablets for years now, and it was the same exact song and dance whenever he went for more refills.  The clinic at Bell Yard had a number of physicians, and William's always made a point to give him a hard time before she would write the script.  She'd pester him about his coffee habits, which he'd given up in the past with no noticeable change.  She'd get on him about drinking and stress, request he try meditation, as if he hadn't tried already and found nothing worked.  It was tiring, but clearly not tiring enough, given William still consistently woke up in the middle of the night.  He figured he could go down during lunch sometime within the next few days and face the inevitable music.

What was it about the hours of the early morning, anyways?  William remembered standing in front of the mirror, looking at himself holding an empty bottle in his sleepwear with his hair disheveled.  William remembered looking into his own eyes, the pale grey, seeing ashes and cold dark stone. 

He looked up to Enoch and gave a small smile.  "You're likely right."

Enoch confident smirk was larger. "Of course I am."

A waitress must of stealthily dropped off more drinks, because William's empty Mimosa was replaced with a fresh one.  He picked it up and took a sip.

Before he could set it down again, the sound of shattering glass filled the dining room, and then the scream resonated throughout the hall.

A woman, from the middle of the restaurant.  William didn't even need time to think, he stood up and looked out over the room.  He found it quickly, the table with the knocked over chair.  He had to consciously relax his right hand.  Instinct had brought it to hover by his hip, by the revolver.  There wasn't a need this immediate second.  As far as he could tell there was no danger, just a woman lying on the ground.  He could barely make her out from where he stood.

A number of patrons had stood up attempting to get a look at whatever the commotion was.  William shot Enoch the briefest of glances then made for the woman, working his way through the tables and people.  He pulled the brassard out of his pocket and yanked it up his left arm.  William reached the spot, and thankfully found it clear of people.  The woman, probably in her early forties, lay on the ground unconscious, surrounded by shattered glass.  A startled looking waiter stood over the scene, clutching his serving tray.  William called out to him and pointed to his armband.

"Could you grab a broom?"

The waiter stared at the brassard for a second, then back to William and nodded, mumbling out something that was probably a yes.  William walked over to the table, cautious of the glass.  A startled looking, conscious woman still sat, a hand over her mouth.  He made sure to speak slow and clear to her.

"Is this your friend?"

The woman nodded quickly.  William squatted down to the unconscious woman lying on her side.  It'd be best to get her on her back, but not with glass everywhere.

"Did anything happen before?  Was she grabbing her throat or coughing?"  He looked down.  She seemed to be breathing fine, and his worry dissipated slightly, until he caught sight of her arm.  It sported a thick red gash.

He heard the other woman behind him. "N-no, nothing like that, we were just talking, then Elena dropped her glass..."

"Was she drinking?"

"Just t-the one"

William looked up and was surprised to meet eyes with Enoch, standing a few feet away.  He must of followed William over.  His voice was measured and calm, and it rose above the surrounding disorder.  "How can I help?"

A small pool of blood was collecting around the woman's arm.  William looked down to the wound then back up to Enoch.  "Could you stop the bleeding?"

Enoch leaned in to get a look, and his face twisted with concern upon the sight.  "Of course."

In William's peripheral vision, the waiter from earlier approached, carrying the requested broom.  While Enoch went looking for a clean napkin, they began to clear out the glass.  Once the worst of it was swept away William turned the woman on her back, and Enoch knelt down and pressed a cloth up against her arm.  A pained, sort of sympathetic sound barely escaped his throat.  William began checking her vitals; she was still breathing, her pulse was elevated but not scarily so.  He heard Enoch's voice, but he didn't look up.

"It seems rather deep..."

"Looks like it."  William gave a look around, a few gawkers/good Samaritans stood around.  There was the original waiter too, his head held just a little higher, his face ever so slightly less aghast.  William picked the most helpful looking bystander.  "Go outside and yell for a guard.  Say there's an unconscious woman with a deep cut."  He returned a quick "Yes sir" and made off.  Then the waiter.  "Surely you have medical supplies somewhere?"  He nodded and returned to the backrooms.

She seemed stable enough.  William tried to respectfully undo her collar and belt, and he grabbed the purse underneath the table and used it to prop up her legs.  At this point there wasn't much more he could do.  The cut was concerning of course, and would require stitches, but Enoch was doing his best with it.  They would have to wait for a Paramedic, or the woman to regain consciousness.  

William looked over to Enoch, the blood on his hands.  Their eyes met, and William could see the question linger behind them before Enoch could even ask.

"She's okay, breathing fine.  I think she just fainted.  A paramedic should be on their way soon."

Enoch nodded.  His hands were steady and determined, but the look on his face gave away his nerves.  "You're doing fine."

An uncomfortable chuckle escaped Enoch.  "I'm just glad to help."

A minute or so later the waiter returned with the first aid kit and an employee William presumed was the manager.  He was in the middle of explaining who he was to the man when the woman began to stir next to him.  William stopped, placed a hand on her shoulder.

"Ah Ma'am, please stay still."

Her right arm was held rather firmly by Enoch, but she brought her left to her head.  She mumbled something, but William couldn't make a discernable word out.  

"Ma'am, you're in Lavande, the restaurant?  You seem to have passed out."

She lowered her right hand, squinted her eyes as they were exposed to the light.  They eventually settled on William.

"I'm a guard."  He made sure she could see his left arm.  "You passed out, cut your arm in the process.  Please stay still, the Medic should be here soon."

For a moment she blinked, trying to get her wits about her, William bet.  He hadn't actually paid much attention to how she looked.  The button up shirt she wore was covered in blue squares, and he had already undone the belt on her high waisted skirt.  It was high society wear, complimenting the cleanly done makeup and her curled dark brown hair.  William and Enoch both matched the look themselves, the restaurant did have a dress code after all.  

"Oh, a guard."  The woman tensed up, ever so slightly.  She raised the good arm to try and push her hair out of her face, and then she looked around yet again, eyes hanging on Enoch this time, scrutinizing. 

"Why do I feel I have seen you before?"

Enoch smiled politely.  "Perhaps in the newspaper, Miss.  My name is Enoch Larreau."

She was regaining her wits, quite quickly actually.  It took her a second, but once the dots connected she exclaimed out, "The Senator!?"

Enoch was using that voice, the polite and formal one he used when speaking with the public.  "Exactly so."

She began to fidget under William's hand.  He kept it firm, but she managed to look around back to the table. 

"Nadine!  This man is Senator Larreau, you know, the Minister of State?"

For the still conscious woman at the table, Nadine, what was once nervousness had melted into exasperation.  "Elena, please, you just passed out!"

Elena obviously hadn't notice, but her jostling was giving Enoch a hard time.  William leaned in, gently squeezed her shoulder.  "Ma'am..."

She turned to him sharply.  "So, who does that make you?"

"Captain Belafose, of the docks, Ma'am please..."

He was once again sharply cut off.  "The new Captain!  Goodness me, so many prominent men, and helping me, how charming!"  She met William's eyes.  "I do feel rather fine now though..."

William turned his tone commanding as he interrupted her.  "Ma'am."

She abruptly stopped.

"You have a rather deep cut on your left arm.  Please stay still, we called the Medics, they should be here soon."

She seemed stunned silent for a moment, before she looked back to Enoch, and the arm he clasped a pile of soaked red napkins and gauze to.  "A cut.  I... didn't notice."

"Do you feel any pain?"

She thought for a moment.  He seemed to have managed to get her to stop fidgeting at least.  "No... well, a dull sort of ache, but it feels... far away."  She paused.  "Is that helpful?  It doesn't feel right."

William looked to Enoch, he held a puzzled expression.  Before William could respond Elena spoke up again.

"Did they dim the lights in here?  It seems darker."

Enoch's expression grew further bewildered, and for a moment William was too, but something popped into the back of his mind.

"Ma'am."  He pointed to the armband.  "The color here, what do you see?  Does it look right?"  The brassards were Asier's blue, it was plastered all over the city.  Unmistakable to anyone spending more than an hour walking her streets.

Elena spent a moment scrutinizing it then spoke quietly, her voice concerned  "No, it's dull, grey."  She squinted.  "Maybe little green too."

"Do you feel a dropping sensation in your stomach."

She thought for a moment, then looked a little stunned.  "Well now that you mention it..."

William put a hand to her forehead.  She was a little cold as well.  Fainting was also a symptom, and while the lower blood pressure could be caused by the cut...

"Well?"  Enoch was staring, his eyes demanded answers.

First to the woman.  "You're fine.  It should wear off soon." Hopefully.  Then to them both.  "Disordered color perception is a fairly sure sign of Arcanic Overexertion.  Its when the limited energy within a person gets pulled a little too hard."  He looked back down to the woman, and gave her shoulder another reassuring squeeze.  "People only have so much fire in them, after all."

She mouthed out the words "Arcanic Overexertion", then blurted out "Wait, why?"

William shrugged.  "You would know better than me."

"But I can't think of anything that would cause..."  She began to fidget again.

"Please don't worry Ma'am.  The Medics will know more.  It tends to wear off fairly quickly, so I don't see any cause for concern."

As if on cue, commotion lit up the entryway of the restaurant.  A few guards dressed in their polished armor and two Paramedics in their red and tan uniforms.  William gave Elena a reassuring smile and nod then passed off his spot to the medical personnel.  He exchanged a few words with the guards then walked over to Enoch.  He was standing on the outskirts of the chaos, hands bloody and looking, despite his best effort, unnerved.

"One of the perks of living in the city, right?" William said as he approached.

"...What?"

"The quick medical attention.  None of that is yours right?"  He gestured to Enoch's hands.

Enoch looked at William with a muddled expression, then he looked to his hands, then he noticeably cringed.  "I don't think so."

Nonetheless, William grabbed one and took a careful look.  "Just making sure, there was a lot of glass."  He grabbed a napkin and tried to wipe the worst of it off.  After he was sure Enoch was completely unharmed, he let go.  "If you want to go clean up, I'll wait by the table?"

Enoch spoke softly.  "Probably a good idea."

They parted ways for the moment, and William returned to their original spot by the wall.  Their meal wasn't entirely finished, but he didn't have much of an appetite anymore, and William was positive Enoch didn't either.  He did have most of a Mimosa left.  He sat down and took a long sip. 

Arcanic Overexertion.  What a weird ailment to come across in the wild.  William had contended with people suffering from it in the past.  It wasn't... completely unknown in his line of work.  After all, he frequently dealt with the consequences of wayward magic usage, and overexertion was a common result of such affairs.  Human beings had this remarkable ability to transpose their inner energies back out onto the outside world; that's all it really was.  Life, light, what some would go so far to call the soul could be harnessed with either enough training or carefully engineered aids.  If one knew how, they could take that energy and direct it to change the "resting state" of the outside world.  A trained mage could start a fire with their hand, manipulate a sound, cause an object to float.  The only condition being it couldn't be done for free.  That was where the overexertion came in.  The mage gave up their own energies, their own fire, to fuel the change they wished to see in the world, and if they gave up too much there were consequences.  Mainly a dropping in blood pressure and a complete loss of ability to correctly process sensory information.  It could get worse too, William knew, but most of the time the symptoms never went past that.  It was awfully hard to keep casting when unconscious.

William could have been wrong about the woman.  There was no way she was a mage, but Arcanic Overexertion could be spurred on from other external sources.  It didn't matter much at this point anyways.  The medics would handle things from here, and if he was wrong they would be able to tell.

He heard the chair across from him pull out, and Enoch took a seat.

"Better?"

Enoch lifted a now clean palm up.  "Yes."

"Good."  William looked out to the middle of the restaurant.  Things seemed to be suitably handled.  He looked back to Enoch.  "Thank you for the help back there.  I know  it was a little...."

"Bloody?"

William nodded.

"Please, make no mention of it."  Enoch leaned back in the chair.  "I know I'm not trained for these situations, such as you, but I am honestly just happy to be of assistance."  He looked out to the paramedics, helping the woman into a stretcher.  "I will say, I'm not particularly keen to stay much longer though."

"Let me flag someone down."  It took a second, but after the two woman were escorted out of the restaurant William managed to make eye contact with the manager from earlier.  In a second he came over.  He immediately showered them with gratitude.  A little unnecessary in William's opinion.

"And please don't worry about the bill."

Enoch was quick.  "Nonsense, we can pay."  He looked around the manager to the now empty middle table.  "You dropped theirs though, right?"

"Of course, and I'll get that for you right away then."

William polished off the Mimosa, it would have been a sin to not finish it, really, and waited for the manager to return.  It didn't take long, and Enoch immediately took out his wallet.  William was idly staring off into the dining room until he caught the flash of color.  He always forgot that Enoch had his family crest embroidered on its front.  It certainly added a uniqueness to the dark leather, but it helped that Enoch's crest was so distinctive.  Seven white wings, arranged in a circle, and a flame held in the middle, trapped by the feathers.  William stared at it as Enoch counted out the Florins for the meal.  Then William stared at the Florins.  All eight of them.  Eight Florins for lunch, that was the real sin.  William would have taken the free meal.

When he was done Enoch looked over, and the two of them departed the establishment. 

The fresh air hit William's face, and he took a deep breath.  There were no taxis waiting outside, but one would come by soon enough.  For now Enoch still looked a little unsteady on his feet.  

"I'm going to ride with you home, I want to make sure you make it okay."

Enoch looked over, in slight surprise.  "You don't need to do that."

"Don't worry about it, I'm not busy today anyways."

Enoch capitulated quickly with a small sigh.  For a moment they both stood, around them only the sounds of the city.  

William looked out to the road and then up to the surrounding buildings.  They didn't reach as high here as they did in other other districts, but they still dwarfed any man who dare stand in their shadow.  He didn't look to Enoch when he spoke.  "Take a deep breath.  Everyone is safe."

Enoch did just that.  Against the backdrop of the city, the perpetual noise of civilization, they both waited.
